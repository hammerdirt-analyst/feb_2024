The assistants function is to assist the researcher in placing the current litter survey results within the context 
their own projects. This includes conducting analysis that is not considered in the federal report. Another example 
is defining reports on administrative boundaries that are not considered in the federal report.

The assistant is here: https://chat.openai.com/g/g-FHnNhEZOC-hammerdirt

This tool started as an assistant to me when the project of refactoring the IQAASL project was initiated. While some 
fields are reticent to adopt this technology it is mandatory in the data science and application development fields. 

The _checking the assistant_ section is where users can check the data and methods of the assistant.

```{note}
We have reproduced the figures in all the reports produced thus far. We are now training the model to defaults so 
that clients have access to a standardised display of the results. 
```
