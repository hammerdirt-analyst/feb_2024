## Sampling stratification Lac Léman 2015-11-15 2021-12-31: The environmental features surrounding the survey location.

Each survey location is surounded by a buffer zone of radius = 1 500 meters. The buffer zone is comprised of land-use features, each land use feature occupies a proportion of the buffer zone (0 - 100%). The land-use-profile is measured by considering the proportion of the buffer dedicated to each of land use feature that is present in the buffer zone. Each location has the same size buffer zone. What changes is how the land use features are distributed within the buffer zone, That is we can group locations by the similarity of the measured topographical features present in the buffer

The sampling-stratification of the surveys revealed distinct patterns across various land use features. For locations where 0-20% of the buffer was dedicated to buildings, 6% of the surveys were conducted. In the same range for wetlands, all surveys (100%) were taken. The proportion for forest in this buffer category was 87%, while public services accounted for 78%. Additionally, 100% of the samples in the 0-20% buffer range were associated with recreation. Undefined land use was represented by 80%, with 19% assigned to streets, 98% to vineyards, and 100% to orchards.

Regarding the 20-40% buffer zone, 14% of surveys were taken in areas dedicated to buildings, with no surveys conducted where wetlands were dominant. The forest representation dropped to 2%, while public services accounted for 20%. There were no surveys in recreation, but 15% of the area was marked as undefined, 20% for streets, and no coverage for vineyards or orchards.

In the 40-60% buffer category, less than 1% of surveys were conducted for buildings, while there were no wetland surveys. Forest land use had an 11% representation, with 2% for public services. Undefined was at 5%, and the streets received 37% of the allocation, alongside a minor representation for vineyards and no orchards.

In areas where 60-80% of the buffer dedicated to buildings, 19% of the samples were collected, with no survey presence for wetlands. Forest features were not present, and there were no public services. The undefined category recorded no samples, while streets received 11% recognition along with no vineyard or orchard presence.

Finally, in the 80-100% buffer allocation, 61% of the samples were from buildings, with no surveys for wetlands or forest features. There were no public services, recreation, or undefined samples recorded, while streets had 14%, and there was no representation for vineyards or orchards.

## Cluster analysis Lac Léman 2015-11-15 2021-12-31

The survey locations were labeled according to the type and magnitude of land use in a 1 500 m buffer zone aroundaround each survey location. A cluster analysis was performed using K-Means clustering, the optimal amoount of clusters was determined using the the elbow method. Each cluster represents a group of locations that have similar land use profiles, that is the locations are surrounded by similar quantities of buildings or forest or wetlands.We consider the cluster composition and the proportion of each cluster dedicated to a particular land use. For example if the value for forest, cluster 1 = .45 then that means that in cluster 1, the average sample was taken from a location whose buffer zone was 45% dedicated to forest. 


Lac Léman: Cluster composition

In cluster 0, the average proportions of land use features were as follows: public services accounted for 0.126, buildings made up 0.362, forest was 0.044, undefined areas constituted 0.393, vineyards contributed 0.087, orchards represented 0.114, streets comprised approximately 0.184, and recreation had a negligible value of about 3.46945e-18. In cluster 1, buildings accounted for the entire proportion at 1, with public services at 0.079, and no presence of forest, undefined areas, vineyards, orchards, streets, or recreation aside from a minimal recreation value of 0.02. In cluster 2, public services represented 0.171, buildings were at 0.876, there was no forest or vineyards, undefined areas accounted for 0.017, orchards were absent, streets took a full value of 1, and recreation had a value of 0.041.

## Summary of regression methods Lac Léman 2015-11-15 2021-12-31: The different linear models the data were tested on

In addition to grid approximation using Bayesian techniques the following linear and ensemble regression models were used. The feature variables are the land-use features identified in the land-use profile. From the scikit-learn standard package: LinearRegression, RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor, TheilSennRegressor. The model with the lowest r² is then used in the BaggingRegressor and the VotingRegressor.



The regression analysis results reveal various models with their respective performances measured by the coefficient of determination (R²) and mean squared error (MSE). The Linear Regression model yielded an R² of 0.703764 and an MSE of 0.245836. Following closely, the Random Forest Regression produced an R² of 0.696169, with an MSE of 0.252139. The Gradient Boosting Regression showed a slightly lower performance with an R² of 0.645679 and an MSE of 0.294038. The Theil-Sen Regressor had an R² of 0.584863 and an MSE of 0.344508, indicating the least effectiveness among the models analyzed. Conversely, the Bagging: Linear Regression model achieved the highest R² of 0.714658 alongside an MSE of 0.236795. Notably, the Voting model outperformed all others with an impressive R² of 0.760621 and the lowest MSE of 0.198652, highlighting its superior predictive capability.

## Feature and permutation importance Lac Léman 2015-11-15 2021-12-31


__Model feature importance__

Feature importance is a technique used in machine learning to identify and quantify the significance of different input variables (features) in predicting the target variable. In models like decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting machines, feature importance is often calculated by measuring how much the model's accuracy or error changes when a particular feature is included versus when it is excluded. 

The model feature importance reveals that public-services has a coefficient of 0.238966, buildings has a coefficient of -1.19688, forest has a coefficient of 0.351349, and undefined has a coefficient of -0.895117. Additionally, vineyards has a coefficient of -0.357741, orchards has a coefficient of -0.111475, streets has a coefficient of -0.22372, and recreation has a coefficient of -0.156634.

__Permutation feature importance__

Permutation importance is a model-agnostic method for assessing the importance of individual features in a predictive model. It is particularly useful because it can be applied to any type of model, whether it's a linear model, a decision tree, or a complex ensemble model. This method involves randomly shuffling the values of a feature in the dataset and observing the impact on the model's performance. A significant drop in performance indicates that the feature is important.

The model feature importance for various land-use features is as follows: buildings have an importance of 3.62822, followed by undefined with an importance of 2.66444. The importance of vineyards is 0.713474, while forest has an importance of 0.233081. Public-services have an importance of 0.111176, and streets are assigned an importance of 0.10502. Recreation has an importance of 0.0741021, and finally, orchards have an importance of 0.0154312.

## Forecasts grid approximation Lac Léman 2015-11-15 2021-12-31

Grid approximation of the posterior is a technique used in Bayesian inference to estimate the posterior distribution of parameters by discretizing the parameter space and evaluating the posterior probability at each point on a grid. This method is especially useful when the posterior distribution does not have a closed-form solution and when the parameter space is of low dimensionality, allowing for a feasible grid search. We use two priors, one is a weigheted combination of survey results from locations similar to the likelihood. The other prior uses the samples taken from the same location, but prior to the specified date range
