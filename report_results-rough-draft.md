The quantity, average density, % of total and fail rate per object category

At the beach, a comprehensive survey revealed a variety of objects. The most prevalent object identified was the cigarette filters, categorized under code G27, with a total quantity of 1,563 found, representing 71.7% of the total objects collected. Following this, food wrappers, specifically candy and snacks, accounted for 565 items under code G30, making up 25.9% of the total. Lastly, straws and stirrers were recorded under code G35 with 52 units found, which contributed to 2.4% of the total count. Together, these three categories constituted a significant majority of the beach debris collected, emphasizing the ongoing issue of waste found along coastal environments.

## Sampling stratification Bern 2015-11-15 2021-12-31: The environmental features surrounding the survey location.

Each survey location is surounded by a buffer zone of radius = 1 500 meters. The buffer zone is comprised of land-use features, each land use feature occupies a proportion of the buffer zone (0 - 100%). The land-use-profile is measured by considering the proportion of the buffer dedicated to each of land use feature that is present in the buffer zone. Each location has the same size buffer zone. What changes is how the land use features are distributed within the buffer zone, That is we can group locations by the similarity of the measured topographical features present in the buffer

The sampling stratification of the surveys revealed several key distributions of land use features. In locations where 0-20% of the buffer was dedicated to buildings, 31% of the samples were collected. Conversely, in this same proportion of buffer allocation, 100% of the samples were taken from wetlands, while 24% were associated with forest. Interestingly, 100% of the surveys included public services, recreation, and there was a 35% collection for undefined categories. Streets accounted for 45% of the samples, and all samples were taken from locations with 0-20% of the buffer dedicated to vineyards and orchards.

In the buffer zone where 20-40% was allocated, 38% of the samples were linked to buildings, with 66% in forest areas, while no samples were found in wetlands or public services. Recreation and undefined categories both accounted for 8% of the samples, and again, no data was collected on vineyards or orchards.

For areas where 40-60% of the buffer was allocated, 22% of samples were linked to buildings, while no samples were recorded for wetlands or public services. In this category, 9% of the buffers were composed of forest, with a notable 57% allocated to the undefined feature and 19% to streets.

In locations with 60-80% of the buffer dedicated to land use, only 7% of the samples were linked to buildings, and again, no samples were associated with wetlands or public services. However, 20% of the buffer was dedicated to streets with no relevant data on vineyards or orchards.

Finally, in the 80-100% buffer category, only 3% of the samples were connected to buildings, and no data was obtained from any other land use features.

## Topography and trash density Bern 2015-11-15 2021-12-31: The changes in the observed litter density and the changes in land use

The land use profile allows us to group locations according to the topography. Here we consdider how the observed litter density changes based on the land use feature and the proportion of the buffer-zone that the feature occupies

In the analysis of the average pieces of trash per meter observed at various topographical features, the first index, corresponding to features occupying 0-20% of the buffer, showed buildings with 0.608261, wetlands at 0.710946, forest at 0.359444, public-services at 0.710946, recreation at 0.710946, undefined at 1.14731, streets at 0.350606, vineyards at 0.710946, and orchards at 0.710946. For the second index, representing features occupying 20-40% of the buffer, buildings had an observation of 0.235714, while wetlands, public-services, and recreation had 0, forest observed 0.907959, undefined was at 1.175, streets recorded 0.681667, and both vineyards and orchards had 0. In the third index, for features occupying 40-60% of the buffer, buildings were recorded at 1.83188, with wetlands and public-services at 0, forest at 0.235714, undefined at 0.374524, streets at 0.344286, and vineyards and orchards again at 0. In the fourth index, indicating 60-80% buffer occupancy, buildings had 0.414, wetlands, forest, public-services, and recreation recorded 0, undefined at 0, and streets had a significant 1.942, while vineyards and orchards were 0. Lastly, for the fifth index, reflecting 80-100% of the buffer, buildings had 0.32, while wetlands, forest, public-services, recreation, and undefined registered 0, streets at 0.5, and both vineyards and orchards again noted 0.

## Cluster analysis Bern 2015-11-15 2021-12-31

The survey locations were grouped using K-Means clustering, the optimal amoount of clusters was determined using the the elbow method. We consider the cluster composition and the proportion of each cluster dedicated to a particular land use. For example if the value for forest, cluster 1 = .45 then that means that in cluster 1, the average sample was taken from a location whose buffer zone was 45% dedicated to forest. 


Bern: Cluster composition

In cluster 0, the average proportions of land use features are as follows: public services at 0.024, buildings at 0.591, forest at 0.22, undefined at 0.189, vineyards at 0, streets at 0.363896, and recreation at 0.005. In cluster 1, the values are: public services at 0.007, buildings at 0.159, forest at 0.537, undefined at 0.245, vineyards at 0, streets at 0.0845193, and recreation at 0.005. For cluster 2, the average proportions are: public services at 0.061, buildings at 0.309, forest at 0.107, undefined at 0.541, vineyards at 0.02, streets at 0.49708, and recreation at 0.025. In cluster 3, the features are distributed as follows: public services at 0.003, buildings at 0.047, forest at 0.271, undefined at 0.55, vineyards at 0, streets at 0, and recreation at 0.155. Finally, in cluster 4, the values are: public services at 0.044, buildings at 0.682, forest at 0.153, undefined at 0.149, vineyards at 0.015, streets at 0.251846, and recreation at 0.005.

## Summary of regression methods Bern 2015-11-15 2021-12-31: The different linear models the data were tested on

In addition to grid approximation using Bayesian techniques the following linear and ensemble regression models were used. The feature variables are the land-use features identified in the land-use profile. From the scikit-learn standard package: LinearRegression, RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor, TheilSennRegressor. The model with the lowest r² is then used in the BaggingRegressor and the VotingRegressor.



The regression analysis results reveal varying performance across different models. The Linear Regression model achieved an R² value of 0.322546 with a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.420651. In contrast, the Random Forest Regression model produced a lower R² of 0.260129 and a higher MSE of 0.459407. The Gradient Boosting Regression stood out with an R² of 0.440842 and an MSE of 0.347197, indicating a strong fit. The Theil-Sen Regressor recorded an R² value of 0.373587 and an MSE of 0.388957, showcasing a moderate performance. The Bagging: Gradient Boosting Regression model followed closely with an R² of 0.405025 and an MSE of 0.369437. Finally, the Voting model reported an R² of 0.381679 and an MSE of 0.383933, suggesting it performed reasonably among the tested models. Overall, the Gradient Boosting Regression model emerged as the most effective based on the highest R² and the lowest MSE.

## Feature and permutation importance Bern 2015-11-15 2021-12-31


__Model feature importance__

Feature importance is a technique used in machine learning to identify and quantify the significance of different input variables (features) in predicting the target variable. In models like decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting machines, feature importance is often calculated by measuring how much the model's accuracy or error changes when a particular feature is included versus when it is excluded. 

The model feature importance values indicate that streets have an importance of 0.504974, followed by forest with an importance of 0.217429. Recreation is assigned an importance of 0.140989, while public-services has an importance of 0.0725408. Vineyards have an importance of 0.0534952, and buildings are given an importance of 0.00789937. Lastly, the undefined feature holds an importance of 0.0026724.

|    | Feature         |   Importance |
|---:|:----------------|-------------:|
|  5 | streets         |   0.504974   |
|  2 | forest          |   0.217429   |
|  6 | recreation      |   0.140989   |
|  0 | public-services |   0.0725408  |
|  4 | vineyards       |   0.0534952  |
|  1 | buildings       |   0.00789937 |
|  3 | undefined       |   0.0026724  |


__Permutation feature importance__

Permutation importance is a model-agnostic method for assessing the importance of individual features in a predictive model. It is particularly useful because it can be applied to any type of model, whether it's a linear model, a decision tree, or a complex ensemble model. This method involves randomly shuffling the values of a feature in the dataset and observing the impact on the model's performance. A significant drop in performance indicates that the feature is important.

In the model feature importance, streets have an importance value of 0.399419, followed by forest with 0.147153. Recreation holds an importance of 0.0259323, while public-services has a value of 0.0239799. Buildings have an importance of 0.0131419, and vineyards show no importance with a value of 0. The undefined feature has a minor negative importance of -0.00209017.

|---:|:----------------|-------------:|
|  5 | streets         |   0.399419   |
|  2 | forest          |   0.147153   |
|  6 | recreation      |   0.0259323  |
|  0 | public-services |   0.0239799  |
|  1 | buildings       |   0.0131419  |
|  4 | vineyards       |   0          |

## Forecasts grid approximation Bern 2015-11-15 2021-12-31

Grid approximation of the posterior is a technique used in Bayesian inference to estimate the posterior distribution of parameters by discretizing the parameter space and evaluating the posterior probability at each point on a grid. This method is especially useful when the posterior distribution does not have a closed-form solution and when the parameter space is of low dimensionality, allowing for a feasible grid search. We use two priors, one is a weigheted combination of survey results from locations similar to the likelihood. The other prior uses the samples taken from the same location, but prior to the specified date range
