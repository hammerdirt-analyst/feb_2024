## Sampling stratification

Sampling stratification refers to the method of dividing a population into subgroups (or strata) to ensure that each subgroup is adequately represented in the samples collected. In the context of this survey, land-use describes the various features present in the buffer zone surrounding each survey location, which can include urban, forest, wetlands, and other land types. The sampling stratification and trash density tables provide insight into how trash density varies depending on the proportion of different land-use features present in the buffer zones. 

In the sampling stratification and trash density table, the highest pieces of trash per meter (pcs/m) values from the specified categories are observed in the forest and buildings columns. In the buildings category, the highest value is 2.00 pcs/m, observed in the 40-60% buffer zone, where 3.2% of the samples were taken. For the forest category, the highest value is 2.43 pcs/m, observed in the 40-60% buffer zone, where 6.5% of the samples were collected. These values indicate that areas with a significant presence of buildings or forest may experience higher trash density, suggesting that the characteristics of the land-use can be a factor in litter accumulation.

### Frequently asked questions

**1. What does the sampling stratification table tell us?**  
The sampling stratification table provides detailed insights into the distribution of samples based on land-use features and the corresponding trash density. For instance, in the buildings category, 3.2% of samples were taken from locations where buildings occupied 40-60% of the buffer zone, and the average trash density was 2.00 pcs/m. In terms of undefined land use, 77.4% of samples were collected in the 40-60% buffer zone, with an average of 1.25 pcs/m. These examples illustrate how specific land-use conditions correlate with varying levels of litter density, indicating areas that may require further investigation or intervention.

**2. How can the information in the sampling stratification and trash density table help identify areas of concern?**  
The information in the sampling stratification and trash density table is crucial for identifying areas of concern regarding litter accumulation. By analyzing the density of trash in relation to specific land-use features, stakeholders can pinpoint locations that exhibit higher levels of pollution. For example, if a particular area shows a significant amount of trash per meter in a densely populated or recreational zone, it may indicate a need for increased waste management efforts or community awareness campaigns. This data-driven approach allows for targeted interventions and better resource allocation to mitigate littering issues.

**3. Under what land-use conditions would a surveyor expect to find the most trash?**  
A surveyor would expect to find the most trash in areas where buildings occupy a significant proportion of the buffer zone. For instance, in the 40-60% buffer zone for buildings, the average trash density is 2.00 pcs/m. Similarly, in areas categorized as undefined land use within the same buffer zone, the average density is 1.25 pcs/m. These conditions suggest that urbanized environments or areas lacking defined land-use management may experience higher litter density due to increased human activity and insufficient waste disposal practices.

**4. Given the results in the sampling stratification table, were these surveys collected in mostly urban environments or forested?**  
Based on the definitions provided, the surveyed locations do not meet the criteria for being classified as urban or rural. The sum of the proportions for buildings in the 60-80% and 80-100% categories is less than 50%, indicating that urban classification is not applicable. The same applies to the forest classification, where the corresponding sum is also less than 50%. The proportions of the buffer that contained the greatest sample proportions for the buildings category was 3.2% in the 40-60% range, while for the forest category, it was 0% in both 60-80% and 80-100% ranges. This indicates a mixed classification for the surveyed areas.

## Linear and ensemble regression

Cluster analysis (specifically K-Means) is a method used to group data points into distinct clusters based on their similarities. In this approach, the optimal number of clusters is determined using methods such as the elbow method, which helps in identifying how many clusters best represent the data without overfitting. 

The cluster that had the highest average density of objects found per meter of beach (pcs/m) is cluster 0, with a value of 1.39 pcs/m. The composition of this cluster in terms of land use features is as follows: buildings occupy approximately 0.68 (68%) of the buffer, forest occupies 0.15 (15%), and undefined land use occupies 0.15 (15%).

Linear regression is a statistical method that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. The basic assumptions of linear regression include linearity of the relationship, independence of errors, homoscedasticity (constant variance of errors), and normality of error terms. Ensemble regression, on the other hand, combines predictions from multiple models to improve accuracy and robustness. This method also assumes that the individual models are independent and that their predictions can complement each other. 

In the regression analysis conducted, the model that had the highest R² value is the Random Forest Regression, which achieved an R² of 0.86 and a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.12. Given this high R² value, predictions made using this model would be considered reliable, as it indicates that the model explains a significant proportion of the variance in the data. Additionally, the MSE suggests a relatively low level of error in predictions, further supporting the model's reliability.

### Frequently asked questions

**What were the r² and MSE of each test?**  
The results of the regression analysis are as follows:

|    | Model                            |       R² |      MSE |
|---:|:---------------------------------|---------:|---------:|
|  0 | Linear Regression                | 0.81     | 0.16     |
|  1 | Random Forest Regression         | 0.86     | 0.12     |
|  2 | Gradient Boosting Regression     | 0.52     | 0.40     |
|  3 | Theil-Sen Regressor              | 0.79     | 0.17     |
|  4 | Bagging:Random Forest Regression | 0.75     | 0.21     |
|  5 | Voting                           | 0.76     | 0.20     |

**Given the r² and MSE of the different methods employed, how reliable do you think predictions would be based on these models?**  
Based on the R² and MSE values from the various regression models, predictions would be quite reliable, particularly from the Random Forest Regression which has the highest R² of 0.86 and the lowest MSE of 0.12. This indicates strong predictive capability and low error in the predictions made by this model. Other models also show varying degrees of reliability but fall short of the Random Forest Regression.

**Can any conclusions be drawn from these results?**  
Yes, conclusions can be drawn from these results indicating that the Random Forest Regression model is the most effective among those tested, as it explains a high proportion of variance in the data while also maintaining a low mean squared error. This suggests that land-use features have a significant impact on the prediction of the target variable, and that ensemble methods may provide enhanced predictive performance.

**According to the cluster analysis, what is the cluster that has the greatest average pcs/m? What is the distribution of land use values within the cluster?**  
The cluster that has the greatest average pcs/m is cluster 0, with a value of 1.39 pcs/m. The distribution of land use values within this cluster, expressed as the percentage of buffer occupied by land use features, is as follows: buildings occupy 68%, forest occupies 15%, and undefined land use occupies 15%.

## Forecasts and methods

A grid approximation is a numerical method used to estimate the distribution of a parameter, specifically the likelihood of observing a certain litter density given the land use profile of a survey location. The construction of a grid approximation involves discretizing the continuous parameter space into a discrete grid of points, which can be analyzed using an inference table. An inference table is a structured representation of data that helps in understanding the relationship between prior data and current observations, allowing for the calculation of posterior probabilities based on Bayes' theorem.

In an inference table, the terms "prior" and "posterior" refer to the probability distributions used to make predictions. The prior represents the initial belief or knowledge about the parameter before considering the current data, whereas the posterior is the updated belief after incorporating the new evidence. In the context of the report, the two priors utilized are:

1. **Combined Prior Grid Approximation**
   - Similarity threshold: 0.74
   - Average pcs/m: 0.77
   - Median pcs/m: 0.57

2. **Out Boundary Grid Approximation**
   - Similarity threshold: 0.74
   - Average pcs/m: 0.65
   - Median pcs/m: 0.52

The observed result from the summary statistics shows an average of 1.35 pcs/m. Comparing the average pcs/m of both priors to the observed results indicates that both priors predict lower litter densities than what was observed. The difference between the observed average and the averages from each prior is as follows:

- Combined Prior: 1.35 - 0.77 = 0.58 pcs/m
- Out Boundary Prior: 1.35 - 0.65 = 0.70 pcs/m

Given these differences, one might expect a decrease in observed litter density in the future, as both priors suggest lower average densities compared to the observed values. If an individual takes one sample, the likelihood of noticing an increase or decrease would depend on the variability of the data; however, considering the standard deviation of the observed results (0.95 pcs/m), a single sample may not be representative. With two samples, the likelihood of capturing the average litter density increases, but variability remains a factor.

### Frequently asked questions

**1. Why is grid approximation a reasonable modeling technique given the data?**  
Grid approximation is suitable because it allows for the incorporation of prior knowledge from similar locations to inform predictions. The mean of the observed data (1.35 pcs/m) is higher than the median (1.04 pcs/m), indicating a potential skew. This suggests that the data may not be normally distributed, which could impact the reliability of predictions based on normal distribution assumptions. If the data were normally distributed, predictions would typically center around the mean, but the skew implies that predictions made through grid approximation may be more cautious in estimating future values.

**2. Do you have an example of other fields or domains that use grid approximation or Bayesian methods?**  
Grid approximation and Bayesian methods are widely used in fields such as ecology for species distribution modeling, epidemiology for disease outbreak prediction, and finance for risk assessment in investments.

**3. If the data is normally distributed would the predictions from the grid approximation and the predictions from the normal distribution be different? If so in what way?**  
Yes, if the data is normally distributed, predictions from a normal distribution model would center around the mean, potentially leading to different expectations for population parameters than grid approximation, which incorporates prior knowledge and may provide a more conservative estimate.

**4. What is the difference between grid approximation and linear or ensemble regression?**  
Grid approximation focuses on estimating the likelihood of observations based on prior distributions, while linear regression models relationships between variables with a focus on predicting outcomes based on linear relationships. Ensemble regression combines multiple models to improve prediction accuracy, while grid approximation relies on prior knowledge and observed data to create a probability distribution.

**5. With which posterior do we expect to find most? The least?**  
The combined prior grid approximation is expected to yield the highest average density (0.77 pcs/m), while the out boundary grid approximation is expected to yield the lowest average density (0.65 pcs/m).

**6. If the in-boundary grid approximation predicts an increase or decrease, what does that say about the other samples from within the boundary?**  
If the in-boundary grid approximation predicts an increase, it implies that elevated litter densities were likely observed in other locations within the boundary compared to the likelihood, suggesting a consistent pattern of higher litter presence in those areas.

**7. If the out-boundary grid approximation predicts an increase or decrease, what does that say about the other samples from outside of the boundary?**  
If the out-boundary grid approximation predicts an increase, it indicates that locations outside of the region had elevated litter densities compared to the likelihood, suggesting that regions external to the boundary contribute to higher litter levels.

**8. How different are the expected results from the observed results? Should an increase or decrease be expected?**  
The expected results from the combined prior (0.77 pcs/m) and out boundary prior (0.65 pcs/m) are both lower than the observed average of 1.35 pcs/m, indicating that a decrease in observed litter density may be expected in the future given the average differences of 0.58 and 0.70 pcs/m respectively.
