The primary message is that if we want to reduce plastics in the environment, we need to know where and what they are. 

The target audience is administrators and politicians who are interested in reducing plastics in the environment.

The tone or mood is informative and questioning. It celebrates people discovering the environment around them and the efficient
transformation of observations into actionable data for policymakers. The first report proved that a relatively small team could cover 
a large territory with the correct technology. This remains the case. That is why we see this project, in its current itteration, 
specifically attractive to stakeholders with an internal data-science team. Stakeholders with experience in python or 
R will feel right at home in the development environment and will be the source of many improvements. 

This is the second project the first project was a success. The median pieces of trash per meter of shoreline was 1.8 or 180 pieces of trash per 100 meters.
The initial project collected 54 000 objects from 143 locations in 380 samples. In all 11 lakes, 16 rivers and 77 municipalities were concerned.

To reduce plastics in the environment, we must first understand where they are and what they consist of.

In Switzerland, we have taken significant steps to tackle this issue by developing statistical indicators that track plastics along our lakes and rivers.

With our first project, we successfully showed that a small, dedicated team could cover a large territory with the right technology. By Collecting and identifying 54,000 objects from 143 locations, our findings revealed a median of 180 pieces of trash per 100 meters of river or lake shoreline.

Now, we are excited to launch the second phase of this project. In collaboration with regional NGOs and public administrations 
this project seeks to develop statistical indicators to evaluate the success of plastic mitigation and prevention projects within Switzerland.

Currently, there is no quantitative way to evaluate the success of these projects in terms of real/perceptible reductions. Considering the 
millions of CHF allocated to these projects, it is crucial to have a reliable way to measure their effectiveness. 

Based on a long tradition of citizen science, beach-litter inventories are a powerful way to evaluate the variety and quantity of plastics 
we are likely to encounter in the environment after all mitigation and prevention measures have been implemented. The sampling can be reproduced
with minimal training allowing local communities to monitor their own progress.


The project gives voice to local, regional and national stakeholders who are interested in reducing plastics in the environment.
