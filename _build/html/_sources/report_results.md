## Inventory items Bern 2015-11-15 2021-12-31 : The complete list of the objects found and indentified included in this report.

The quantity, average density, % of total and fail rate per object category

At the beach, an extensive survey revealed various objects littering the shoreline. The primary contributor to the debris was identified as code G27, which represents cigarette filters with a total quantity of 1,563, accounting for approximately 71.7% of the total debris found. Following this, code G30 represents food wrappers for candy and snacks, with a total of 565 items, contributing about 25.9% of the overall count. Although other objects were noted, such as G35, which refers to straws and stirrers with only 52 pieces, its contribution of approximately 2.4% did not reach the substantial threshold of 50%. Hence, only the first two codes were significant in comprising over half of the total debris collected during the survey.

| code   |   quantity |    pcs/m |   % of total |   sample_id |   fails |     rate | object                       |

## Sampling stratification Bern 2015-11-15 2021-12-31: The environmental features surrounding the survey location.

Each survey location is surounded by a buffer zone of radius = 1 500 meters. The buffer zone is comprised of land-use features, each land use feature occupies a proportion of the buffer zone (0 - 100%). The land-use-profile is measured by considering the proportion of the buffer dedicated to each of land use feature that is present in the buffer zone. Each location has the same size buffer zone. What changes is how the land use features are distributed within the buffer zone, That is we can group locations by the similarity of the measured topographical features present in the buffer

The sampling-stratification of the surveys revealed the following distribution across various land use features. In the 0-20% buffer zone category, 31% of the samples were collected at locations with buildings, while all samples (100%) collected in this zone were from wetlands. Furthermore, 24% of the samples were from locations where the buffer had a presence of forest, and again, all samples noted public services, recreation, and undefined features were represented at this level. The proportion of samples collected associated with streets was 45%, while 100% of the samples accounted for vineyards and orchards were located within this buffer.

For the 20-40% buffer zone, 38% of the surveys were conducted at locations with buildings, whereas no samples were taken from wetlands. Here, 66% of the samples represented forested areas. No samples were collected related to public services or recreation in this category, while undefined features accounted for 8% and streets were at 8% as well. 

In the 40-60% buffer zone, 22% of samples were dedicated to buildings with no wetlands sampled. Only 9% of the samples represented forest, and similarly, no public service-related samples were recorded. The undefined category constituted 57% at this buffer level, with 19% of the samples indicating streets. 

The 60-80% buffer zone presented a minor finding with only 7% of the samples linked to buildings and no wetlands. No samples for forest were noted, while undefined features remained at 0%. Streets were sampled at a rate of 20%.

Lastly, within the 80-100% buffer, only 3% of samples were attributed to buildings with nil representation for wetlands or forest. All remaining categories (public services, recreation, undefined, streets, vineyards, and orchards) had no contributions in this buffer zone.

## Cluster analysis Bern 2015-11-15 2021-12-31

The survey locations were grouped using K-Means clustering, the optimal amoount of clusters was determined using the the elbow method. We consider the cluster composition and the proportion of each cluster dedicated to a particular land use. For example if the value for forest, cluster 1 = .45 then that means that in cluster 1, the average sample was taken from a location whose buffer zone was 45% dedicated to forest. 


Bern: Cluster composition

In cluster 0, the average proportions are as follows: public services 0.024, buildings 0.591, forest 0.22, undefined 0.189, vineyards 0, streets 0.363896, and recreation 0.005. For cluster 1, the values are: public services 0.007, buildings 0.159, forest 0.537, undefined 0.245, vineyards 0, streets 0.0845193, and recreation 0.005. In cluster 2, the proportions recorded are: public services 0.061, buildings 0.309, forest 0.107, undefined 0.541, vineyards 0.02, streets 0.49708, and recreation 0.025. Cluster 3 shows the following values: public services 0.003, buildings 0.047, forest 0.271, undefined 0.55, vineyards 0, streets 0, and recreation 0.155. Finally, in cluster 4, the average proportions include: public services 0.044, buildings 0.682, forest 0.153, undefined 0.149, vineyards 0.015, streets 0.251846, and recreation 0.005.

## Summary of regression methods Bern 2015-11-15 2021-12-31: The different linear models the data were tested on

In addition to grid approximation using Bayesian techniques the following linear and ensemble regression models were used. The feature variables are the land-use features identified in the land-use profile. From the scikit-learn standard package: LinearRegression, RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor, TheilSennRegressor. The model with the lowest r² is then used in the BaggingRegressor and the VotingRegressor.



The regression analysis conducted yielded varying results across different models. The Linear Regression model exhibited an R² value of 0.322546 and a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.420651. In contrast, the Random Forest Regression model recorded a lower R² of 0.260129 and a higher MSE of 0.459407. The Gradient Boosting Regression emerged as the most effective model, achieving an R² of 0.440842 and an MSE of 0.347197. Meanwhile, the Theil-Sen Regressor provided a respectable R² of 0.373587 with a MSE of 0.388957. The Bagging: Gradient Boosting Regression followed closely, presenting an R² of 0.39959 and an MSE of 0.372812. Lastly, the Voting model had an R² of 0.381679 and an MSE of 0.383933. Overall, the Gradient Boosting Regression demonstrated the best performance in this analysis.

__Model feature importance__

Feature importance is a technique used in machine learning to identify and quantify the significance of different input variables (features) in predicting the target variable. In models like decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting machines, feature importance is often calculated by measuring how much the model's accuracy or error changes when a particular feature is included versus when it is excluded. 

In the model feature importance analysis, the streets feature has an importance value of 0.507286, followed by forest with a value of 0.217692. The recreation feature holds an importance of 0.141604, while vineyards have an importance of 0.0723108. Public services contribute an importance of 0.0520371, and buildings are assigned a minor importance of 0.00590474. Lastly, the undefined feature has an importance value of 0.00316526.

|    | Feature         |   Importance |
|---:|:----------------|-------------:|
|  5 | streets         |   0.507286   |
|  2 | forest          |   0.217692   |
|  6 | recreation      |   0.141604   |
|  4 | vineyards       |   0.0723108  |

|  1 | buildings       |   0.00590474 |
|  3 | undefined       |   0.00316526 |


__Permutation feature importance__

Permutation importance is a model-agnostic method for assessing the importance of individual features in a predictive model. It is particularly useful because it can be applied to any type of model, whether it's a linear model, a decision tree, or a complex ensemble model. This method involves randomly shuffling the values of a feature in the dataset and observing the impact on the model's performance. A significant drop in performance indicates that the feature is important.

The model feature importance for various land-use features includes streets with an importance of 0.393727, forest at 0.151795, recreation at 0.0332308, public-services at 0.0213098, buildings at 0.0100022, vineyards with an importance of 0, and undefined features at -0.00191259.

## Forecasts grid approximation Bern 2015-11-15 2021-12-31

Grid approximation of the posterior is a technique used in Bayesian inference to estimate the posterior distribution of parameters by discretizing the parameter space and evaluating the posterior probability at each point on a grid. This method is especially useful when the posterior distribution does not have a closed-form solution and when the parameter space is of low dimensionality, allowing for a feasible grid search. We use two priors, one is a weigheted combination of survey results from locations similar to the likelihood. The other prior uses the samples taken from the same location, but prior to the specified date range
