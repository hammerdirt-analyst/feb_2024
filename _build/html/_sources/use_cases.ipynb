    "__Conclusion:__ The expected average survey result for lakes in the canton of Bern is expected to increase from 1.96 pcs/m in 2017 - 2019 to 3.06 in 2025. The campaign of 2017-2019 only had 24 samples versus 74 in 2021. Given that the sampling campaigns were managed by different organizations and were initiated for different purposes we can not be sure about the magnitude of the increase. However, the results from other lakes in Switzerland suggest that __an increase is more likely than a decrease__.\n",

    "__Notes:__ Comparing the sample totals is not the best way to make this type of analysis. We know that 74% of the total can be accounted for by 15 different objects. Comparing like items or grouping like items would provide a more accurate representation of the expected sample results for 2025.\n",
