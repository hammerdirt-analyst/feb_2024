In the context of the multinomial-Dirichlet conjugate relationship, this method is particularly effective. The Dirichlet distribution serves as the prior for the multinomial likelihood, and empirical Bayes methods estimate this prior directly from the data. By defining a grid of possible parameter values, in this case spaced every 0.1 units from 0 to the maximum observed value or 100, the posterior distribution is approximated by evaluating the likelihood and updating the Dirichlet prior at each grid point.\n",

Instead of integrating over a continuous parameter space, which can be analytically challenging, grid approximation transforms the problem into a finite summation.
