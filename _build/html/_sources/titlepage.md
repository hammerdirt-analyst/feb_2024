This is the proposed format and layout for an up-dated survey of the trash along swiss rivers, lakes and hiking trails. We have created reports for five cantons and one that provides a _federal perspective_. 

There have been developments in the domain of beach litter reporting since the first federal project. The Guide for Monitoring Litter on European seas was updated in 2023, the code system has changed for classifying objects and in May 2024 a guide for monitoring and removing plastics from inland waters was released.

Developments in the fields of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) give us new ways to assess the results of surveys and synthesise the current research. Topics of interest for those charged with reducing or preventing plastics in the environment.

The data in these reports is a combination of observations from variety of groups in Switerland since 2015. The observations were recorded using an interpretation of the _Guide for Monitoring Marine Litter on European Seas_ [The guide](https://mcc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/main/dev.py?N=41&O=439&titre_chap=TG%20Litter&titre_page=Guidance%20for%20the%20Monitoring%20of%20Marine%20Litter). The guide and the monitoring of beach litter are part of decades of research, here is the brief history [A Brief History of Marine Litter Research](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-16510-3_1).
