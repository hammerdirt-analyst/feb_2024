The UX and final app structure can be tested here (! the llm is not yet attached): [litter assisstant](https://litterassistant.streamlit.app/)

Interested contributors can check the repo: https://github.com/hammerdirt-analyst/litterassistant 
The assistants function is to assist the researcher in placing the current litter survey results within the context of their own projects. This includes conducting analysis that is not considered in the federal report. Another example is defining reports on administrative boundaries that are not considered in the federal report.

The _checking the assistant_ section is where users can check the data and methods of the assistant.

```{note}
We have reproduced the figures in all the reports produced thus far. We are now training the model to defaults so 
that clients have access to a standardised display of the results.
