# Assessing environmental plastics and litter

This project builds on the experiences from the first federal assessment of litter density, the new Guide for monitoring marine litter in the EU, collaboration with the Association Pour la Sauvegarde du LÃ©man and the expertise  of our team members, all of whom made significant contributions to the first report. 

## Goals

* Develop a reporting and research tool for stakeholders in the waste management, life cycle assessment and environmental monitoring sectors.
* Increase capacity of stakeholders to monitor and report observations according to the current standard in the federal report.
* Implement a cloud first infrastructure for data collection and reporting.


### Objectives

The objectives are in support of the goals, in some cases one objective may support multiple goals.

1. Collect 400 - 500 samples in a 12 month period
   * reduce the number of items reported as _fragmented_ or _Gfrags_ 
     1. This value can range from 20% - 30% of the total items collected
   * include polymer identification for a subset of samples
     1. Subset should support an academic publication
     2. Subset should support a regional assessment of polymer types
   * increase knowledge sharing between surveyors
   * 1. Capacity building for surveyors
   
2. Increase the number of associations competent to collect and report data
   * Develop one association on Lac de Constance or Zurichsee
   * Develop training materials and protocols with ASL 

3. Strucutre report specifically for cantonal and municipal reporting
   * Revise and improve the current report
   * Consider the format of the report given cantonal requirements (attached) 

4. Build upon previous research and reports
   * Continue to develop modeling and parameter estimation for litter density
   * Focus on topographical features and densities
   * Consider polymer types and densities

5. Define groups of objects of interest with stakeholders
   * single use plastics
   * agricultural plastics
   * construction plastics
   * industrial plastics

6. Develop a cloud first infrastructure for data collection and reporting
   * Move all data and software assests to Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
   * Develop machine learning and artificial intelligence pipelines for data analysis
   * Develop Automated programming interfaces (APIs) for data collection and reporting
   * Develop a user interface for data collection and reporting
   * Define access controls and user roles.

## Deliverables

Consider a three year contract:

1. 700 samples
2. Revised updated federal report
3. Cloud service for cantonal and municipal reporting
4. Article for publication

### Benchmarks

1. Year one: Proposed updates and revisions to the fedral report. Prposed model for cantonal and municipal reporting.
   * Formal research proposal for polymer identification
   * Formal research proposal for topographical features
   * Functioning prototype of cloud service
   * 100 samples collected
2. Year two: 
   * Assesment of software and data collection
   * Federal report with current data
   * Update on capacity building
   * End of year two:
     1. Presentation of revised report with current data
     2. Summary of capacity building
     3. 400 samples
     3. Request for feedback
3. Year three:
   * Presentation of feedback
   * Proposed changes to app and report
   * Final report:
     1. implementation of feeedback
     2. 200 samples
     3. cloud service for cantonal and municipal reporting
