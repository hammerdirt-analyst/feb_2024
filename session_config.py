NOTE: This module is a work in progress.

This module is a configuration file for the litter assisstant. The configuration file is used to define the feature and
target variables, give the location of the default data, and define the columns of interest. The configuration file also
contains the aggregation methods and names the columns. Defines the 90% range, the bins and labels for land use, the
radius of the land use buffer and keys for sorting the data in the userinterface.

1. Analysis of Sampling Stratification and Sampling stratification and trash density tables
   * Objective: Ensure conclusions about the presence or absence of objects are based on a combined interpretation of sampling stratification and litter density data.
   * Data Validation: Confirm that any conclusions about trash density and land use are supported by the presence of samples in the sampling stratification table"
   * Interpretation Guidelines: Analyze how the distribution of land-use features influences the observed trash density. 
   * Draw conclusions only when both stratification and density data are aligned. Make sure to check all the values for a given land-use feature and proportion of buffer zone. Before making any conlusions"
   * A zero in the trash density table indicates that no objects were found for that land-use feature and proportion of buffer zone.

2. Reporting Geographic Information

   * Always provide the names of all the cities, cantons, and survey areas included in the report.
   * Always provide the names of all the lakes, rivers, and parks included in the report.

3. Definitions of Urban, Rural Areas, fail-rate

   * Urban Areas: The proportion of samples where building occupy 60% or more of the buffer is greater than 50%.\n
   * Rural Areas: The proportion of samples where forest occupy 60% or more of the buffer is greater than 50%.\n
   * Mixed Areas: Does not meet the criteria of urban or rural.\n
   * Fail Rate: The proportion of samples where at least one of the object categories was found.\n
   
**Example How to calculate urban, rural or mixed sampling stratification: consider the example sampling stratification table**

1. test one: Sum the rows '60 - 80%' and '80 - 100%' in the sampling stratification table under the buildings column, if the table
reads 'no samples' that is equivalent to 0. 

2. test two: Sum the rows '60 - 80%' and '80 - 100%' in the sampling stratification table under the forest column, if the table
reads 'no samples' that is equivalent to 0. 

3. Make the conclusion: If test one is greater than 50% then the classification is urban. If test two is greater than 50% then 
the classification is rural. If neither test one or test two is greater than 50% the the classification is mixed.\n

where buildings occupy 80 - 100% of the buffer is .16 therefore the proportion of samples where buildings occupy more than 
50% of the buffer is .16 + .18 or 34%.\n

2. test two: Sum the rows '60 - 80%' and '80 - 100%' in the sampling stratification table under the forest column. In the example 
table above, the proportion of samples where forest occupy 60-80% of the buffer is 0 (no samples)  and the proportion of 
samples where forest occupy 80 - 100% of the buffer is 0 (no samples) therefore the proportion of samples where forest occupy
more than 50% of the buffer is 0.\n

3. Make the conclusion: If the value of test one is greater than 50% then the area is urban. If the value of test two

     "\n### Grid Approximation method:\n\n"
    "We employed a grid-based Bayesian inference approach to estimate the conditional probability that a "
    "survey result will exceed or be equal to a given value, using prior observations from similar locations "
    "and new data from the location of interest. The prior represents survey data from locations either inside "
    "or outside a designated boundary, segmented by geographic or administrative criteria, while the likelihood "
    "reflects observations from the specific location being analyzed. The grid spans the range of possible values, "
    "from 0 to the maximum value observed in either the prior or likelihood data, with a fixed interval of 0.01.\n\n"

    "For each point x on this grid, we calculated the conditional probability that a survey result, y, would exceed "
    "or be equal to x. This was modeled using a binomial distribution, where the successes represent the number of times "
    "y was greater than or equal to x, and failures represent the number of times y was less than x, for both the prior and "
    "the likelihood. By applying Bayes' Theorem, we combined the prior and likelihood distributions to compute the posterior "
    "distribution at each grid point, providing a detailed estimate of the probability that a survey outcome exceeds any value "
    "across the range of interest.\n\n"

    "In our method, the grid points act as thresholds, and the posterior probability at each grid point corresponds to the "
    "likelihood that a survey result exceeds or equals that value. This setup is analogous to a multinomial distribution, where "
    "each grid point is treated as a category and the probability of an event occurring in each category is computed. Extending "
    "this approach to a multinomial framework would simplify the computational process, as the Dirichlet distributionâbeing the "
    "conjugate prior to the multinomialâwould allow for efficient posterior updates. This relationship ensures that Bayesian updating "
    "remains computationally straightforward, even in more complex settings where probabilities are distributed across multiple categories."
