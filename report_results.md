## Sampling stratification Bern 2015-11-15 2021-12-31: The environmental features surrounding the survey location.

Each survey location is surounded by a buffer zone of radius = 1 500 meters. The buffer zone is comprised of land-use features, each land use feature occupies a proportion of the buffer zone (0 - 100%). The land-use-profile is measured by considering the proportion of the buffer dedicated to each of land use feature that is present in the buffer zone. Each location has the same size buffer zone. What changes is how the land use features are distributed within the buffer zone, That is we can group locations by the similarity of the measured topographical features present in the buffer

The sampling-stratification of the surveys yielded diverse results across different proportions of buffer zones. In locations where 0-20% of the buffer was dedicated to buildings, 31% of the samples were collected. Conversely, all samples in this range were taken from areas with 100% of the buffer allocated to wetlands. Additionally, 24% of the samples came from locations where forests constituted 0-20% of the buffer. As for public-services, 100% of the samples were collected from locations with 0-20% of the buffer dedicated to this feature. Notably, recreation also captured 100% of the samples in the same range, while there was a 35% sample collection from areas categorized as undefined. Streets accounted for 44% of the samples in the 0-20% buffer zone category, with all samples strictly taken from locations where vineyards, and orchards received 100% of buffer allocation.

In the 20-40% buffer range, 38% of the samples were taken from locations where buildings made up that proportion, while 66% of samples were taken from forested areas in the same buffer range. Here, no samples were collected for wetlands, public-services, or recreation. For undefined land use features, 8% of the samples were captured. The streets in this category accounted for 8% as well, with no sample collections for vineyards or orchards.

When examining the 40-60% buffer zone, 22% of the samples were attributed to buildings, but again, no samples were recorded for wetlands. A reduced portion of just under 10% was allocated to forests, while 57% of sample points were classified as undefined. Streets contributed 19% to this category, with no vineyards or orchards incorporated.

In the 60-80% buffer allocation, a mere 6% were sampled from building areas, and there were no observations in wetlands and recreation. Undefined areas comprised of no samples, while streets represented 20%. The 80-100% allocation for buildings reflected just 3% of the samples, while wetlands and other land use categories received no representation in the collected data.

## Sampling stratification and trash density Bern 2015-11-15 2021-12-31: The changes in the observed litter density and the changes in land use

The land use profile allows us to group locations according to the topography. Here we consdider how the observed litter density changes based on the land use feature and the proportion of the buffer-zone that the feature occupies

In the 0-20% proportion of buffer, the average pieces of trash observed were 0.608261 for buildings, 0.710946 for wetlands, 0.359444 for forest, 0.710946 for public-services, 0.710946 for recreation, 1.14731 for undefined, 0.350606 for streets, 0.710946 for vineyards, and 0.710946 for orchards. In the 20-40% range, the values recorded were 0.235714 for buildings, 0 for wetlands, 0.907959 for forest, 0 for public-services, 0 for recreation, 1.175 for undefined, 0.681667 for streets, and 0 for both vineyards and orchards. For the 40-60% proportion, buildings had an average of 1.83188 pieces of trash, while wetlands and public-services had no observed trash, and forest had 0.235714, undefined had 0.374524, and streets had 0.344286, with both vineyards and orchards showing no trash. In the 60-80% range, buildings showed 0.414, wetlands had no trash, while 0 was observed for forest and public-services, undefined remained at 0, whereas streets had 1.942, with vineyards and orchards both at 0. Lastly, the 80-100% proportion exhibited values of 0.32 for buildings, 0 for wetlands, and both forest and public-services at 0, undefined remained at 0, and streets showed 0.5, with vineyards and orchards still at 0.

## Cluster analysis Bern 2015-11-15 2021-12-31

The survey locations were labeled according to the type and magnitude of land use in a 1 500 m buffer zone aroundaround each survey location. A cluster analysis was performed using K-Means clustering, the optimal amoount of clusters was determined using the the elbow method. Each cluster represents a group of locations that have similar land use profiles, that is the locations are surrounded by similar quantities of buildings or forest or wetlands.We consider the cluster composition and the proportion of each cluster dedicated to a particular land use. For example if the value for forest, cluster 1 = .45 then that means that in cluster 1, the average sample was taken from a location whose buffer zone was 45% dedicated to forest. 


Bern: Cluster composition

In cluster 0, the average magnitudes of land use features are as follows: public services at 0.024, buildings at 0.591, forest at 0.22, undefined land at 0.189, vineyards at 0, streets at 0.363896, and recreation at 0.005. Cluster 1 shows public services at 0.007, buildings at 0.159, forest at 0.537, undefined land at 0.245, vineyards at 0, streets at 0.0845193, and recreation at 0.005.

## Feature and permutation importance Bern 2015-11-15 2021-12-31


__Model feature importance__

Feature importance is a technique used in machine learning to identify and quantify the significance of different input variables (features) in predicting the target variable. In models like decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting machines, feature importance is often calculated by measuring how much the model's accuracy or error changes when a particular feature is included versus when it is excluded. 

In the model feature importance analysis, streets have an importance value of 0.506552, followed by forest with an importance of 0.217582. Recreation is assigned an importance of 0.140934, while public-services holds an importance of 0.0702452. Vineyards have an importance value of 0.0555594, and buildings are noted with an importance of 0.00634318. Lastly, the undefined feature is given an importance value of 0.00278472.

|  3 | undefined       |   0.00278472 |


__Permutation feature importance__

Permutation importance is a model-agnostic method for assessing the importance of individual features in a predictive model. It is particularly useful because it can be applied to any type of model, whether it's a linear model, a decision tree, or a complex ensemble model. This method involves randomly shuffling the values of a feature in the dataset and observing the impact on the model's performance. A significant drop in performance indicates that the feature is important.

The model feature importance highlights that streets have an importance score of 0.394198, followed by forest with a score of 0.149632. Recreation is noted with an importance of 0.0303555, while public-services holds an importance of 0.0251921. Buildings have a lower importance score of 0.00960234. Vineyards show no importance with a score of 0, and undefined features have a slight negative importance of -0.00157627.

## Forecasts grid approximation Bern 2015-11-15 2021-12-31

Grid approximation of the posterior is a technique used in Bayesian inference to estimate the posterior distribution of parameters by discretizing the parameter space and evaluating the posterior probability at each point on a grid. This method is especially useful when the posterior distribution does not have a closed-form solution and when the parameter space is of low dimensionality, allowing for a feasible grid search. We use two priors, one is a weigheted combination of survey results from locations similar to the likelihood. The other prior uses the samples taken from the same location, but prior to the specified date range
