## Sampling stratification Bern 2020-04-01 2021-05-01: The environmental features surrounding the survey location.

Each survey location is surounded by a buffer zone of radius = 1 500 meters. The buffer zone is comprised of land-use features, each land use feature occupies a proportion of the buffer zone (0 - 100%). The land-use-profile is measured by considering the proportion of the buffer dedicated to each of land use feature that is present in the buffer zone. Each location has the same size buffer zone. What changes is how the land use features are distributed within the buffer zone, That is we can group locations by the similarity of the measured topographical features present in the buffer

The sampling-stratification of the surveys was as follows: 32% of the samples were taken at locations where 0-20% of the buffer was dedicated to buildings. 38% of the samples were taken at locations where 20-40% of the buffer was dedicated to buildings. 21% of the samples were taken at locations where 40-60% of the buffer was dedicated to buildings. 7% of the samples were taken at locations where 60-80% of the buffer was dedicated to buildings. 3% of the samples were taken at locations where 80-100% of the buffer was dedicated to buildings. All of the samples were taken at locations where 0-20% of the buffer was dedicated to wetlands. 25% of the samples were taken at locations where 0-20% of the buffer was dedicated to forest. 65% of the samples were taken at locations where 20-40% of the buffer was dedicated to forest. 10% of the samples were taken at locations where 40-60% of the buffer was dedicated to forest. No samples were taken at locations where 60-80% or 80-100% of the buffer was dedicated to forest. All of the samples were taken at locations where 0-20% of the buffer was dedicated to public-services. All of the samples were taken at locations where 0-20% of the buffer was dedicated to recreation. 35% of the samples were taken at locations where 0-20% of the buffer was dedicated to undefined land use features. 44% of the samples were taken at locations where 0-20% of the buffer was dedicated to streets. 100% of the samples were taken at locations where 0-20% of the buffer was dedicated to vineyards. 100% of the samples were taken at locations where 0-20% of the buffer was dedicated to orchards.

## Sampling stratification and trash density Bern 2020-04-01 2021-05-01: The changes in the observed litter density and the changes in land use

The land use profile allows us to group locations according to the topography. Here we consdider how the observed litter density changes based on the land use feature and the proportion of the buffer-zone that the feature occupies

The average objects per meter based on the sampling stratification was as follows: where buildings occupied 0 - 20% of the buffer, the average objects per meter was 0.70; where buildings occupied 20 - 40% of the buffer, the average objects per meter was 0.36; where buildings occupied 40 - 60% of the buffer, the average objects per meter was 1.89; where buildings occupied 60 - 80% of the buffer, the average objects per meter was 0.58; where buildings occupied 80 - 100% of the buffer, the average objects per meter was 0.36. Where wetlands occupied 0 - 20% of the buffer, the average objects per meter was 0.80; where wetlands occupied 20 - 40% of the buffer, the average objects per meter was 0; where wetlands occupied 40 - 60% of the buffer, the average objects per meter was 0; where wetlands occupied 60 - 80% of the buffer, the average objects per meter was 0; and where wetlands occupied 80 - 100% of the buffer, the average objects per meter was 0.

For public-services, where it occupied 0 - 20% of the buffer, the average objects per meter was 0.80; where it occupied 20 - 40% of the buffer, the average objects per meter was 0; where it occupied 40 - 60% of the buffer, the average objects per meter was 0; where it occupied 60 - 80% of the buffer, the average objects per meter was 0; and where it occupied 80 - 100% of the buffer, the average objects per meter was 0. 

For recreation, where it occupied 0 - 20% of the buffer, the average objects per meter was 0.80; where it occupied 20 - 40% of the buffer, the average objects per meter was 0; where it occupied 40 - 60% of the buffer, the average objects per meter was 0; where it occupied 60 - 80% of the buffer, the average objects per meter was 0; and where it occupied 80 - 100% of the buffer, the average objects per meter was 0. 

For undefined, where it occupied 0 - 20% of the buffer, the average objects per meter was 1.20; where it occupied 20 - 40% of the buffer, the average objects per meter was 1.33; where it occupied 40 - 60% of the buffer, the average objects per meter was 0.48; where it occupied 60 - 80% of the buffer, the average objects per meter was 0; and where it occupied 80 - 100% of the buffer, the average objects per meter was 0. 

For streets, where they occupied 0 - 20% of the buffer, the average objects per meter was 0.39; where they occupied 20 - 40% of the buffer, the average objects per meter was 0.84; where they occupied 40 - 60% of the buffer, the average objects per meter was 0.54; where they occupied 60 - 80% of the buffer, the average objects per meter was 2.01; and where they occupied 80 - 100% of the buffer, the average objects per meter was 0.72. 

For vineyards, where they occupied 0 - 20% of the buffer, the average objects per meter was 0.80; where they occupied 20 - 40% of the buffer, the average objects per meter was 0; where they occupied 40 - 60% of the buffer, the average objects per meter was 0; where they occupied 60 - 80% of the buffer, the average objects per meter was 0; and where they occupied 80 - 100% of the buffer, the average objects per meter was 0. 

For orchards, where they occupied 0 - 20% of the buffer, the average objects per meter was 0.80; where they occupied 20 - 40% of the buffer, the average objects per meter was 0; where they occupied 40 - 60% of the buffer, the average objects per meter was 0; where they occupied 60 - 80% of the buffer, the average objects per meter was 0; and where they occupied 80 - 100% of the buffer, the average objects per meter was 0.
