## Sampling stratification Vaud 2015-11-15 2021-12-31: The environmental features surrounding the survey location.

Each survey location is surounded by a buffer zone of radius = 1 500 meters. The buffer zone is comprised of land-use features, each land use feature occupies a proportion of the buffer zone (0 - 100%). The land-use-profile is measured by considering the proportion of the buffer dedicated to each of land use feature that is present in the buffer zone. Each location has the same size buffer zone. What changes is how the land use features are distributed within the buffer zone, That is we can group locations by the similarity of the measured topographical features present in the buffer

The sampling-stratification of the surveys revealed the following distribution of land use features within the buffer zones. In locations where 0-20% of the buffer was dedicated to buildings, 6% of the samples were collected, whereas 37% of samples came from areas where 60-80% of the buffer was used for buildings. The most significant portion, 49%, was taken where 80-100% of the buffer was allocated to buildings. In contrast, only 1% of the samples were from locations with 20-40% dedicated to buildings. When it came to wetlands, all samples (100%) were taken from locations with 0-20% of the buffer comprised of wetlands. Furthermore, 98% of the samples were in locations where the buffer had 0-20% forest presence, while 2% were from the 20-40% range. In terms of public services, 77% of samples originated from areas where 0-20% of the buffer was allocated, with 20% from the 20-40% range, and a small 2% from the 40-60% range. Recreation was present in 100% of the samples collected where the buffer zone was in the 0-20% category, while 0% was noted for higher buffer percentages. Undefined land uses were observed in 87% of the samples from the 0-20% range and 8% from the 40-60% range. Samples collected from locations with streets predominantly constituted 7% in the 0-20% buffer category, 21% in the 20-40% category, and 41% in the 40-60% category, with no significant presence in higher ranges. Vineyard presence accounted for 98% in the lowest group and showed no presence in the higher allocations. For orchards, every sample collected occurred within the 0-20% buffer stratum.

## Cluster analysis Vaud 2015-11-15 2021-12-31

The survey locations were labeled according to the type and magnitude of land use in a 1 500 m buffer zone aroundaround each survey location. A cluster analysis was performed using K-Means clustering, the optimal amoount of clusters was determined using the the elbow method. Each cluster represents a group of locations that have similar land use profiles, that is the locations are surrounded by similar quantities of buildings or forest or wetlands.We consider the cluster composition and the proportion of each cluster dedicated to a particular land use. For example if the value for forest, cluster 1 = .45 then that means that in cluster 1, the average sample was taken from a location whose buffer zone was 45% dedicated to forest. 


Vaud: Cluster composition

In cluster 0, the features measured reveal that the proportion of public services is 0.079, buildings make up 1, forest is 0, undefined areas account for 0, vineyards are negligible at 6.93889e-18, orchards are at 0, streets constitute 0, and recreation is 0.02. In cluster 1, the average proportions are 0.126 for public services, 0.362 for buildings, 0.044 for forest, 0.393 for undefined, 0.087 for vineyards, 0.114 for orchards, 0.241613 for streets, and 0 for recreation. Meanwhile, cluster 2 shows public services at 0.034, buildings at 0.712, forest at 0.119, undefined at 0.169, vineyards again at 6.93889e-18, orchards at 0, streets at 0.57403, and recreation at 0.001.

## Summary of regression methods Vaud 2015-11-15 2021-12-31: The different linear models the data were tested on

In addition to grid approximation using Bayesian techniques the following linear and ensemble regression models were used. The feature variables are the land-use features identified in the land-use profile. From the scikit-learn standard package: LinearRegression, RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor, TheilSennRegressor. The model with the lowest r² is then used in the BaggingRegressor and the VotingRegressor.



In analyzing the regression results from different models, we observe varied performances based on their R² and mean squared error (MSE) values. The Linear Regression model produced an R² of -0.134713 and an MSE of 0.54701. Following that, the Random Forest Regression displayed an even lower R² of -0.472478 with an MSE of 0.709837, indicating poor predictive capabilities. The Gradient Boosting Regression yielded a slightly better outcome, achieving an R² of 0.0175874 and an MSE of 0.473591. The Theil-Sen Regressor performed similarly to the Linear Regression, obtaining an R² of -0.192662 and an MSE of 0.574946. The Bagging: Gradient Boosting Regression model had an R² of -0.0133138 with an MSE of 0.488488, while the Voting model recorded an R² of -0.0935373 and an MSE of 0.527161. Overall, all models displayed negative or near-zero R² values, suggesting substantial challenges in capturing the data's underlying trends.

## Feature and permutation importance Vaud 2015-11-15 2021-12-31


__Model feature importance__

Feature importance is a technique used in machine learning to identify and quantify the significance of different input variables (features) in predicting the target variable. In models like decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting machines, feature importance is often calculated by measuring how much the model's accuracy or error changes when a particular feature is included versus when it is excluded. 

The model feature importance for land-use features shows that streets have an importance value of 0.43021, followed by buildings with an importance of 0.340828. Forests hold an importance of 0.0945256, while public-services have a value of 0.0583216. Vineyards are assigned an importance of 0.0365385, and undefined features carry an importance of 0.031679. Orchards have a slight importance of 0.0071753, and finally, recreation features have the smallest importance at 0.000721684.

__Permutation feature importance__

Permutation importance is a model-agnostic method for assessing the importance of individual features in a predictive model. It is particularly useful because it can be applied to any type of model, whether it's a linear model, a decision tree, or a complex ensemble model. This method involves randomly shuffling the values of a feature in the dataset and observing the impact on the model's performance. A significant drop in performance indicates that the feature is important.

In the model feature importance, streets have an importance value of 0.276278, followed by buildings at 0.0244517. Vineyards were assigned a value of 0.00780426, while orchards had an importance of 0.00431042. Recreation received a value of 0.00328958, and undefined features were given an importance of 0.000493264. Public services had a slightly negative value of -0.00362615, and forest features were marked with an importance of -0.0560977.

## Forecasts grid approximation Vaud 2015-11-15 2021-12-31

Grid approximation of the posterior is a technique used in Bayesian inference to estimate the posterior distribution of parameters by discretizing the parameter space and evaluating the posterior probability at each point on a grid. This method is especially useful when the posterior distribution does not have a closed-form solution and when the parameter space is of low dimensionality, allowing for a feasible grid search. We use two priors, one is a weigheted combination of survey results from locations similar to the likelihood. The other prior uses the samples taken from the same location, but prior to the specified date range
