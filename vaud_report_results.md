## Sampling stratification Vaud 2015-11-15 2021-12-31: The environmental features surrounding the survey location.

Each survey location is surounded by a buffer zone of radius = 1 500 meters. The buffer zone is comprised of land-use features, each land use feature occupies a proportion of the buffer zone (0 - 100%). The land-use-profile is measured by considering the proportion of the buffer dedicated to each of land use feature that is present in the buffer zone. Each location has the same size buffer zone. What changes is how the land use features are distributed within the buffer zone, That is we can group locations by the similarity of the measured topographical features present in the buffer

The sampling-stratification of the surveys was reported as follows: In locations where 0-20% of the buffer was dedicated to buildings, 5.9% of the samples were collected. Conversely, all surveyed areas within this buffer range had wetlands, revealing a complete dominance of this land use feature. For forest cover, 97.6% of the samples were drawn from locations with a similar buffer proportion, while 77.6% were sampled where public services comprise this same range. Additionally, recreation accounted for 100% in this category, with 87.1% classified as undefined features, while 7.1% were attributed to streets, 97.6% to vineyards, and a full 100% to orchards.

In the 20-40% buffer category, a mere 5.9% of the surveys concerned buildings, and no samples were taken for wetlands. Forest representation was only at 2.4%, while public services garnered 20% of the samples. There were no samples allocated for recreation or vineyards, though 4.7% were categorized as undefined, and 21.2% were attributed to streets. 

Moving to the 40-60% buffer zone, the data indicated 1.2% of the samples were associated with buildings, no samples were recorded for wetlands or forest, and 2.4% were tied to public services. Undefined features received 8.2% of sampling, while 41.2% were linked to streets. In the 60-80% buffer range, 37.6% of samples related to buildings, though no wetlands or forests were present; public services were not represented either. The streets saw a sampling of 17.6%, while undefined features accounted for none. Finally, in the 80-100% proportion, 49.4% of the surveys were conducted at sites primarily consisting of buildings, with no wetlands or forest samples taken. Overall, streets represented 12.9%, and the remaining classifications were not observed within this buffer range.

## Cluster analysis Vaud 2015-11-15 2021-12-31

The survey locations were grouped using K-Means clustering, the optimal amoount of clusters was determined using the the elbow method. We consider the cluster composition and the proportion of each cluster dedicated to a particular land use. For example if the value for forest, cluster 1 = .45 then that means that in cluster 1, the average sample was taken from a location whose buffer zone was 45% dedicated to forest. 


Vaud: Cluster composition

In cluster 0, the average proportions for each land use feature are as follows: public services at 0.079, buildings at 1.0, forest at 0, undefined at 0, vineyards at virtually 0 (6.93889e-18), orchards at 0, streets at 0, and recreation at 0.02. Moving to cluster 1, the average proportions are public services at 0.126, buildings at 0.362, forest at 0.044, undefined at 0.393, vineyards at 0.087, orchards at 0.114, streets at 0.241613, and recreation at 0. In cluster 2, the average proportions are public services at 0.034, buildings at 0.712, forest at 0.119, undefined at 0.169, vineyards at virtually 0 (6.93889e-18), orchards at 0, streets at 0.57403, and recreation at 0.001.

Vaud: Average density per cluster

In cluster 0, the observed sample average for personal use objects is 1.28438 objects per meter of beach. In cluster 1, the average for personal use increases to 1.72533 objects per meter of beach. Finally, in cluster 2, the average drops to 0.581304 objects per meter of beach.


## Summary of regression methods Vaud 2015-11-15 2021-12-31: The different linear models the data were tested on

In addition to grid approximation using Bayesian techniques the following linear and ensemble regression models were used. The feature variables are the land-use features identified in the land-use profile. From the scikit-learn standard package: LinearRegression, RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor, TheilSennRegressor. The model with the lowest r² is then used in the BaggingRegressor and the VotingRegressor.



The results from our regression analyses reveal varying degrees of model performance in predicting the data. The Linear Regression model had an R² of -0.134713 and a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.54701, indicating a poor fit. Similarly, the Random Forest Regression model underperformed with an R² of -0.472478 and an MSE of 0.709837. In contrast, the Gradient Boosting Regression model showed some improvement with an R² of 0.0175609 and a lower MSE of 0.473604. The Theil-Sen Regressor, however, yielded an R² of -0.192662 and an MSE of 0.574946, further illustrating the challenges faced. The Bagging: Gradient Boosting Regression model offered a slightly better performance with an R² of 0.0452012 and an MSE of 0.460279. Lastly, the Voting model returned an R² of -0.0935373 and an MSE of 0.527161, confirming the overall lack of effective predictive power among the models analyzed.

## Feature and permutation importance Vaud 2015-11-15 2021-12-31


__Model feature importance__

Feature importance is a technique used in machine learning to identify and quantify the significance of different input variables (features) in predicting the target variable. In models like decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting machines, feature importance is often calculated by measuring how much the model's accuracy or error changes when a particular feature is included versus when it is excluded. 

The feature importance values for various land-use features are as follows: streets have an importance of 0.429694, buildings hold an importance of 0.330099, and forest contributes 0.0953239. Public-services have an importance of 0.0596757, while undefined features have an importance of 0.041513. Additionally, vineyards have an importance of 0.0364879, orchards hold an importance of 0.00640475, and recreation features are the least important with a value of 0.000801984.

__Permutation feature importance__

Permutation importance is a model-agnostic method for assessing the importance of individual features in a predictive model. It is particularly useful because it can be applied to any type of model, whether it's a linear model, a decision tree, or a complex ensemble model. This method involves randomly shuffling the values of a feature in the dataset and observing the impact on the model's performance. A significant drop in performance indicates that the feature is important.

The model feature importance is as follows: streets have an importance of 0.284312, buildings are at 0.0182715, vineyards hold an importance of 0.00895637, and orchards are valued at 0.00347614. Additionally, recreation has an importance of 0.00329513, while undefined features are rated at 0.00168761. Public services show a negative importance of -0.00394606, and forest has an importance of -0.0561365.

## Forecasts grid approximation Vaud 2015-11-15 2021-12-31

Grid approximation of the posterior is a technique used in Bayesian inference to estimate the posterior distribution of parameters by discretizing the parameter space and evaluating the posterior probability at each point on a grid. This method is especially useful when the posterior distribution does not have a closed-form solution and when the parameter space is of low dimensionality, allowing for a feasible grid search. We use two priors, one is a weigheted combination of survey results from locations similar to the likelihood. The other prior uses the samples taken from the same location, but prior to the specified date range
