## Sampling stratification Vaud 2015-11-15 2021-12-31: The environmental features surrounding the survey location.

Each survey location is surounded by a buffer zone of radius = 1 500 meters. The buffer zone is comprised of land-use features, each land use feature occupies a proportion of the buffer zone (0 - 100%). The land-use-profile is measured by considering the proportion of the buffer dedicated to each of land use feature that is present in the buffer zone. Each location has the same size buffer zone. What changes is how the land use features are distributed within the buffer zone, That is we can group locations by the similarity of the measured topographical features present in the buffer

The sampling-stratification of the surveys reveals the distribution of samples across different land use features within specified buffer zones. In locations where 0-20% of the buffer was dedicated to buildings, 5.9% of the samples were collected, alongside a significant 100% of samples taken from areas with wetlands. Additionally, 97.6% of samples came from locations with forests, 77.6% from public services, and 100% from recreational areas. The undefined category accounted for 87.1%, streets for 7.1%, vineyards for 97.6%, and orchards also for 100%. For locations with 20-40% of the buffer allocated to buildings, 5.9% of samples were collected, with no samples taken from wetlands. Here, only 2.4% of samples were taken from forests, 20% from public services, while streets accounted for 21.2% and the undefined category for 4.7%. In the 40-60% buffer category, 1.2% of samples were collected in relation to buildings, with no samples from wetlands, and 0.0% from forests. However, public services had 2.4%, streets collected 41.2%, and the undefined category occupied 8.2%. The 60-80% category had 37.6% of samples relating to buildings, while no samples were recorded for wetlands or forests, but 17.6% came from streets. Finally, in the 80-100% range, 49.4% of samples were taken from areas with buildings, while no samples were noted for wetlands or forests. Streets accounted for 12.9% of the buffer, illustrating the variation in land use across the surveyed buffer zones.

## Topography and trash density Vaud 2015-11-15 2021-12-31: The changes in the observed litter density and the changes in land use

The land use profile allows us to group locations according to the topography. Here we consdider how the observed litter density changes based on the land use feature and the proportion of the buffer-zone that the feature occupies

At the index where 0-20% of the buffer is occupied, the values recorded for various topographical features reveal that buildings had an average of 0.782 pieces of trash per meter, wetlands had 1.24976, forest showed 1.27361, public-services reported 1.08606, recreation also had 1.24976, while undefined features accounted for 1.33338, streets had 0.835, vineyards recorded 1.26783, and orchards had 1.24976. Moving to the index representing 20-40% occupancy, buildings showed a lower average at 0.318, wetlands had no pieces observed, forest reported 0.26, public-services had a notably high 1.97353, recreation had no observations, undefined was at 0.81, streets had 0.71, while vineyards and orchards had none. At the 40-60% index, buildings peaked with 2.06, while wetlands and forest showed no observations, public-services had 0.5, recreation remained at 0, undefined recorded 0.617143, streets stood at 1.18543, and vineyards returned 0.5, with orchards again having none. For the 60-80% occupied buffer, buildings showed 0.986875, wetlands had no observations, forest also had none, public-services did not report any, recreation had 0, undefined was at 0, streets reported 1.454, while vineyards and orchards showed no pieces. Lastly, at the 80-100% occupancy, buildings averaged 1.59738, wetlands had no observations, forest was absent, public-services recorded 0, recreation was 0, undefined was 0, streets illustrated a high of 2.28545, and both vineyards and orchards had none.

## Cluster analysis Vaud 2015-11-15 2021-12-31

The survey locations were grouped using K-Means clustering, the optimal amoount of clusters was determined using the the elbow method. We consider the cluster composition and the proportion of each cluster dedicated to a particular land use. For example if the value for forest, cluster 1 = .45 then that means that in cluster 1, the average sample was taken from a location whose buffer zone was 45% dedicated to forest. 


Vaud: Cluster composition

In the cluster analysis, cluster 0 has public services at 0.079, buildings at 1, forest at 0, undefined at 0, vineyards at approximately 6.94e-18, orchards at 0, streets at 0, and recreation at 0.02. Cluster 1 shows public services at 0.126, buildings at 0.362, forest at 0.044, undefined at 0.393, vineyards at 0.087, orchards at 0.114, streets at 0.241613, and recreation at 0. Cluster 2 records public services at 0.034, buildings at 0.712, forest at 0.119, undefined at 0.169, vineyards at approximately 6.94e-18, orchards at 0, streets at 0.57403, and recreation at 0.001.

Vaud: Average density per cluster

In cluster 0, the average number of objects per meter of beach is 1.28438, while in cluster 1, it is 1.72533. Cluster 2 shows a lower average of 0.581304 objects per meter of beach.


## Summary of regression methods Vaud 2015-11-15 2021-12-31: The different linear models the data were tested on

In addition to grid approximation using Bayesian techniques the following linear and ensemble regression models were used. The feature variables are the land-use features identified in the land-use profile. From the scikit-learn standard package: LinearRegression, RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor, TheilSennRegressor. The model with the lowest r² is then used in the BaggingRegressor and the VotingRegressor.



The results from the regression analysis reveal various performances across different models. The Linear Regression model showed an unfavorable R² value of -0.134713, accompanied by a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.54701. Similarly, the Random Forest Regression model performed poorly with an R² value of -0.472478 and a higher MSE of 0.709837. Meanwhile, the Gradient Boosting Regression model achieved a slightly better R² of 0.017588 but still incurred an MSE of 0.473591. The Theil-Sen Regressor likewise produced a negative R² of -0.192662, with an MSE of 0.574946. The Bagging: Gradient Boosting Regression model yielded an R² of 0.012066, paired with an MSE of 0.476253. Lastly, the Voting model had an R² of -0.0935373 and an MSE of 0.527161. Overall, these results indicate that none of the models provided significant predictive power based on the R² values, with several models exhibiting negative values.

## Feature and permutation importance Vaud 2015-11-15 2021-12-31


__Model feature importance__

Feature importance is a technique used in machine learning to identify and quantify the significance of different input variables (features) in predicting the target variable. In models like decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting machines, feature importance is often calculated by measuring how much the model's accuracy or error changes when a particular feature is included versus when it is excluded. 

The model feature importance reveals that streets hold an importance value of 0.429574, followed by buildings at 0.33603. Forests are assigned an importance of 0.0941549, while public services have an importance of 0.0539272. Vineyards are noted with an importance of 0.0423964, and undefined features carry an importance of 0.0351222. Orchards are represented by an importance value of 0.00799833, and recreation has the lowest importance at 0.000797625.

__Permutation feature importance__

Permutation importance is a model-agnostic method for assessing the importance of individual features in a predictive model. It is particularly useful because it can be applied to any type of model, whether it's a linear model, a decision tree, or a complex ensemble model. This method involves randomly shuffling the values of a feature in the dataset and observing the impact on the model's performance. A significant drop in performance indicates that the feature is important.

The model feature importance reveals that streets have an importance of 0.278352, while buildings hold an importance of 0.0206069. Vineyards are assigned an importance of 0.00879556, and orchards follow with an importance of 0.00773928. Recreation has an importance of 0.00286505, whereas the undefined feature has an importance of 0.00077437. Public services show a slight negative importance of -0.00419755, and forest is noted with a negative importance of -0.0532492.

## Forecasts grid approximation Vaud 2015-11-15 2021-12-31

Grid approximation of the posterior is a technique used in Bayesian inference to estimate the posterior distribution of parameters by discretizing the parameter space and evaluating the posterior probability at each point on a grid. This method is especially useful when the posterior distribution does not have a closed-form solution and when the parameter space is of low dimensionality, allowing for a feasible grid search. We use two priors, one is a weigheted combination of survey results from locations similar to the likelihood. The other prior uses the samples taken from the same location, but prior to the specified date range
