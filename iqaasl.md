# Litter surveys in Switzerland 2020-2021 - IQAASL

Identification, quantification and analysis of anthropogenic Swiss litter (IQAASL) is a project commissioned by the Swiss 
Federal Office for the Environment to collect data concerning visible pollutants along Swiss lakes and rivers. All 
discarded materials were collected and identified using litter survey techniques. in total there were 406 samples from 163 
locations in 95 municipalities.

This report is a summary and analysis of the litter surveys conducted and the methods employed in Switzerland from March
2020 through August 2021. This sampling phase overlaps with the Swiss Litter Report (SLR) survey period, which ran
from April 2017 to March 2018. The SLR was the first project on a national level to use the standard protocol described in 
the Guide to monitoring beach litter or any other comparable method. This overlap allows the results of the 
present study to be compared with those of the SLR.

## Lakes and rivers

The lakes and rivers were sampled from 2020-03 through 2021-05, a total of 54,744 objects were removed and classified over 
the course of 386 surveys. The survey locations were divided into survey areas for regional analysis and defined by the Aare, 
Rhône, Ticino and Linth/Limmat rivers. Surveys were conducted at 143 different locations, representing 77 municipalities. 
The total linear distance surveyed was 20 km with a surface area of 9 hectares and a total municipal population of 1.7 million.

Most surveys were along lake shorelines (331 samples) as lakes offer more consistent and safe year-round access with 
respect to rivers. Additionally, lakes are large areas of reduced flow that receive input from multiple rivers, streams 
and drainage systems providing ideal locations to assess the variety of objects in and around the water bodies.

In total 316 samples came from seven principal lakes in 3 major river basins. Twenty locations were selected to sample 
monthly for a twelve-month period with the exception of Lago Maggiore, which was sampled every three months. 
Surveys were also conducted on Lago di Lugano, Lac des Quatre cantons, Brienzersee and Zugersee. In addition, there 
were 55 surveys on 16 rivers.

### The sampling locations - type and description

The land use is reported as the percent of total area attributed to each land use category within a 1500m radius of the 
survey location. The ratio of the number of samples completed at the different land use profiles is an indicator of the 
environmental and economic conditions around the survey locations.

The land use around the survey locations had a higher attribution to buildings as opposed to agriculture and woods. For 
example, half of all the surveys had at least 37% of land use devoted to buildings as opposed to 19% for agriculture or 
13% to woods. Land use devoted to recreation was at least 6% for half of all samples.

The length of the road network within the buffer zone differentiates between locations that have other wise similar land 
use characteristics. The length of road per buffer ranges from 13km to 212km, 50% of the surveys had less than 67km of road network.

The number of intersections ranges from zero to 23, 50% of the surveys had 3 or fewer intersections within 1500m of the 
survey location. The size of the intersecting river or canal was not taken into consideration. Survey locations on rivers 
have zero intersections.

The population (not shown) is taken from statpop 2018 and represents the population of the municipality surrounding the 
survey location. The smallest population was 442 and the maximum was 415,367, 50% of the surveys come from 
municipalities with a population of at least 12,812.

Overall, surveys at locations with more buildings and more recreation sites were more likely to facilitate the accumulation 
of trash on the shoreline. When the most common objects are considered, only four of the twelve were found at higher rates 
in the presence of more buildings. All of those objects are likely related to food or tobacco consumption near the location. 
Suggesting that there are still gains to be made in prevention and attenuation efforts in areas of high traffic near the water.

However, six of the twelve objects have no positive association to land use attributed to buildings but were found in at 
least 50% of all the surveys. These objects are generally associated with professional use or in the case of cotton swabs 
personal hygiene:

* plastic construction waste
* fragmented plastics
* industrial sheeting
* expanded polystyrene
* cotton bud/swabs
* insulation, includes spray foams

Furthermore, compared to products related to tobacco or food consumption these objects have fewer positive associations in 
general. Indicating that the appropriate land use feature is not currently accounted for and/or these objects are found 
at similar quantities indifferent of the land use features. Suggesting that these objects are ubiquitous in the environment.

Finally, two of the twelve most common objects were found in less than 50% of the surveys and have few positive associations:

* industrial pellets
* expanded foams < 5mm

These objects are found in large quantities sporadically at specific locations. They have been found in all survey areas 
and in all lakes. Industrial pellets have a very specific use and client base making it possible to find partners based 
on the density of the pellets found and the location of the nearest consumer or producer of pellets, see Shared responsibility.


### Median survey total

The results are in units of pieces of litter per 100 meters (p/100m). The median survey result of all data was approximately
189 p/100m. The maximum recorded value was 6,617 p/100m (Rhône survey area) and the minimum recorded was 2p/100m (Aare survey area).
The Rhône survey area had the highest median survey total of 442p/100m, this can in part be explained by the high number
of urban survey locations with respect to the other survey areas and the deposition of fragmented plastics and foamed 
plastics at the Rhône River out flow in the upper lake region.

A reference value was calculated excluding the results from samples that were less than 10m and objects less than 2.5cm. 
This method, described in EU Marine Beach Litter Baselines was used to calculate the reference and threshold 
values for all European beaches in 2015 and 2016 resulting in a median value of 131 p/100m. The results from the European 
baseline value lie outside the 95% confidence interval (CI) of 147 - 213p/100m established using the data from IQAASL.

Surveys in Switzerland were on average, smaller scale than in marine environments and in locations that would be 
considered urban under most circumstances. To date monitoring of lakes and rivers upstream of coastal regions has 
not generalized on the European continent. However, there is a concerted effort by a group of associations in 
Switzerland and France to establish a common monitoring and data exchange protocol for the Rhône basin. Additionally, 
the Wageningen University & Research has begun analyzing data collected in the Meusse - Rhine delta using 
protocols like those in IQAASL.

### The most common objects

The most common objects are defined as those objects identified in at least 50% of all surveys and/or are among the ten 
most abundant by quantity. As a group the most common objects represent 68% of all objects identified in the sampling period. 
Of the most common items 27% are food, drink and tobacco related and 24% are infrastructure and agriculture related.

Objects related to food, drink and tobacco are identified at higher rates at survey locations with a greater percentage 
of land attributed to buildings or fixed infrastructure, the inverse is true of the locations with a higher percentage 
of land attributed to woods or agriculture. However, infrastructure material and fragmented plastics, are found at similar 
rates throughout all survey areas indifferent of land use surrounding the survey locations.

The most common objects identified in the surveys were:

* cigarette ends: total 8'485, % of all objects 15.5%, fail-rate 87%, p/100m 20
* fragmented plastics: total 7'400, 13% of all objects, fail-rate 86%, p/100m 18
* expanded polystyrene: total 5'563, 10% of all objects, fail-rate 68%, p/100m ,
* snack wrappers: total 3'325, 6% of all objects, fail-rate 85%, p/100m 9
* industrial sheeting: total 2'534, 4% of all objects, fail-rate 69%, p/100m 5
* glass drink bottles, pieces: total 2'136, 3% of all objects, fail-rate 65%, p/100m 3
* industrial pellets: total 1'968, 3% of all objects, fail-rate 30%, p/100m 4
* insulation, includes spray foams: total 1'702, 3% of all objects, fail-rate 53%, p/100m 1
* cotton bud/swabs: total 1'406, 2% of all objects, fail-rate 50%, p/100m 1
* expanded foams < 5mm: total 1'209, 2% of all objects, fail-rate 25%, p/100m 0
* plastic construction waste: total 992, 1% of all objects, fail-rate 52%, p/100m 1
* metal bottle caps: total 700, 1% of all objects, fail-rate 52%, p/100m 1



Industrial pellets and expanded foams < 5mm both occurred in significant quantities but identified in less than 50% of 
the surveys (median of 0), indicating high counts at specific locations. While both are micro plastics, their use, 
origin and rate of occurrence are different depending on the survey area region. Industrial pellets are raw materials 
used in injection molding processes whereas foamed plastic beads are the result of fragmentation of expanded polystyrene.


### Conclusions

At the national level, the IQAASL results are stable compared to the surveys that were carried out in 2017 as part of the 
SLR study. However, there was a general decrease in the quantity of food, drink and tobacco objects. Infrastructure 
objects and fragmented plastics and foams did not decline and some locations may have experienced sharp increases. 
Pandemic restrictions limiting large outdoor gatherings may have had a beneficial effect on the reduction of food, drink 
and tobacco items. The greatest increases in infrastructure related objects were in Valais, Vaud and Brienz, which are 
locations near the Rhône and Aare rivers discharge points.

The land use around a survey location has a measurable effect on the deposition of certain objects. The more buildings 
and fixed infrastructure there are the more tobacco and food products are found. Objects like fragmented plastics and 
industrial sheeting do not have the same association and are identified at approximately equal rates indifferent of the 
land use with increases near river/canal discharge points.

Currently three of the four survey areas in the IQAASL are actively monitored by research and governmental agencies 
downstream of Switzerland using similar methods presented in this report. Additionally, regional associations in 
Switzerland are actively pursuing a standardization of reporting and protocols with partner organizations in the EU.

The IQAASL is a citizen-science project that only uses open-source tools and shares data on GNU public license, 
enabling collaboration with stakeholders. At the end of the mandate, December 31, 2021, Hammerdirt will assume the 
responsibility of maintaining the code and data repository which is hosted publicly on Github.

The associations that participated in the IQAASL are actively seeking ways to incorporate the data collection process 
and/or the results into their own business model. However, there is a shortage of data scientists within many regional 
associations which may lengthen the process of integration and stifle the rate of innovation at the level where it is needed most.
