###### Foreword

Synthetic polymers, commonly known as plastics, have made themselves a permanent part of the marine environment for the first time in the long history of planetary seas. No sediment or ice core will reveal ancient deposits of these materials or
the biological consequences associated with high concentrations of synthetic polymers in the planet’s prehistoric ocean. However, current ice and sediment cores do
reveal an abundance of this material. Only a broad combination of traditional fields
of scientific inquiry is adequate to uncover the effects of this new pollutant, and it
seems a pity that a field of study, rather than springing from insights into natural
phenomena, arises from new ways that natural phenomena are compromised.
Reports of plastics in the marine environment began to appear in the early 1970s.
At the time, Edward Carpenter of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution speculated that the problem was likely to get worse and that toxic, non-polymeric compounds in plastics known as plasticizers could be delivered to marine organisms as
a potential effect. Carpenter’s speculations were correct and probably more so than
he imagined. The quantity of plastics in ocean waters has increased enormously,
and toxic plastic additives, as well as toxicants concentrated by plastics from the
surrounding sea water, have been documented in many marine species.
The rapid expansion of the use of synthetic polymers over the last half century
has been such that the characterization of the current era as the “Age of Plastics”,
seems appropriate. There is no real mystery as to why plastics have become the
predominant material of the current epoch. The use value of the material is truly
surprising. It can substitute for nearly every traditional material from millinery to
metal and offers qualities unknown in naturally occurring substances, so that it
now feeds a worldwide industry. The plastic industry creates new applications and
products with growth trending sharply upward and showing no signs of slowing in
the foreseeable future. Laser printing using plastic “ink” will guarantee expanded
use of polymeric feedstocks.
Although the majority of plastics produced today use petroleum resources
which are finite, the carbon backbone of synthetic polymers can be fashioned
from switchgrass, soya beans, corn, sugar cane or other renewable resources—
price alone determines industry’s preference. The fact that synthetic polymers can

be made from row crops (so-called biopolymers) need have nothing to do with
their biodegradability. Olefins are still olefins and acrylates are still acrylates, and
behave like their petroleum-fabricated counterparts. Furthermore, biodegradability
standards are not applicable in the marine environment and marine degradability
requires a separate standard. Marine degradable plastics have a negligible market
share and are not poised to make headway into the consumer plastics market at the
present time. The difficulty of recycling plastics has made their profitable recovery
a problem, which in turn results in failure to provide take-back infrastructure and
results in accelerated pollution.
Given the proliferation of plastics into all spheres of human activity, and their
increasing use value in the developing world, the phenomena associated with plastic pollution of the marine environment will continue to merit scientific investigation. These studies, however, are hampered by the lack of basic geospatial and
quantitative data. Estimates abound based on limited sampling and modeling, but
the ocean is the biggest habitat on the planet by far and knowledge of its plastic pollution will require new methods of data acquisition. The role of citizens in
the monitoring of plastic pollution will increase in the coming years, and the truly
“big” data they document must become part of the science of plastic pollution. For
the present, it is fortunate that a few pioneering scientists around the world are
engaged in attempting to understand the consequences of the plague of plastic that
contaminates our precious ocean.

###### Preface

The ocean is of eminent importance to mankind. Twenty-three per cent of the
world’s population (~1.2 billion people) live within 100 km of the coast (Small
and Nicholls 2003), a figure, which is likely to rise up to 50 % by 2030 (Adger
et al. 2005). Furthermore, the ocean sustains nearly half of the global primary production (Field et al. 1998), a great share of which fuels global fisheries (Pauly and
Christensen 1995). The marine environment hosts a substantial biodiversity, and
tourism is an important and constantly growing economic sector for many coastal
countries. Although human welfare is intricately linked with the sea and its natural
resources, people have substantially altered the face of the ocean within only a few
centuries. Fisheries, pollution, eutrophication, deep-sea hydrocarbon exploration,
ocean acidification and global ocean warming accompanied by sea-level rise as a
consequence of rapid glacier melting and thermal expansion of sea water (IPCC
2014) are prominent examples of man-made pressures exerted on the oceans with
severe ecological and socio-economic repercussions. As a result, marine environmental protection and management have become integral political and societal
issues in many countries worldwide. However, effective environmental management requires a proper understanding of the ecological implications of human
activities and should, therefore, be accompanied by sound multidisciplinary
research, scientific advice, education and public outreach.
In recent decades, the pollution of the oceans by anthropogenic litter has been
recognized as a serious global environmental concern. Marine litter is defined as
“any persistent, manufactured or processed solid material discarded, disposed of
or abandoned in the marine and coastal environment” (UNEP 2009). Since its first
mention in the scientific literature in the 1960s, research efforts addressing marine
litter have constantly grown as has the amount of litter in the oceans. Many studies have shown that it consists primarily of plastics with a continuously increasing global annual production of 299 million t (PlasticsEurope 2015). It has been
estimated that 10 % of all plastic debris ends up in the oceans (Thompson 2006),
and Barnes (2005) suggested that the 1982 figure of 8 million litter items entering
the oceans every day probably needs to be multiplied several fold. Eriksen et al.
(2014) estimate a minimum of 5.25 trillion plastic particles weighing 268,940 tons

afloat in the sea, but this figure does not include debris on the seafloor or beaches.
The increasing use of single-use products, uncontrolled disposal of litter along
with poor waste management and recycling practices is the main reason for the
accumulation of litter in the sea. Increasing quantities of litter are lost from municipal waste streams and enter the oceans (Barnes et al. 2009). The ubiquity of litter
in the open ocean is prominently illustrated by numerous images of floating debris
from the ocean garbage patches and by the fact that the search for the missing
Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 in March 2014 produced quite a few misidentifications caused by litter floating at the water surface.
Since plastic accounts for the majority of litter items in the sea, the chapters of
this book primarily focus on plastic litter and its implications for the marine environment. Numerous quantitative reports on marine anthropogenic litter from various parts of the world’s oceans indicate that anthropogenic litter is ubiquitous at the
shores as well as in the pelagic and benthic realms. Global surveys revealed that plastics have already reached the shores of the remotest islands (Barnes 2005) and even
polar waters far off urban centres (Barnes et al. 2010; Bergmann and Klages 2012).
The use of advanced technology, such as remotely and autonomously operated vehicles, revealed that anthropogenic litter has conquered the deep sea before mankind
set eye upon it suggesting that the deep seafloor may constitute the ultimate sink for
marine litter (Pham et al. 2014). However, we are just beginning to understand how
litter actually “behaves” at sea and to identify the drivers of the temporal and the
spatial distribution of litter in the oceans. Still, we have already started to generate a
mankind memory made out of plastic in the world ocean.
Marine anthropogenic litter causes harm to a wide range of marine biota.
Seabirds, fish, turtles and marine mammals suffer from entanglement with and
ingestion of marine litter items as illustrated by countless pictures of animals
injured and strangled by discarded fishing gear in the public media. However,
we have only limited knowledge about the implications of marine litter for the
many less charismatic invertebrate species that easily escape public perception but play important roles in marine ecosystems. Although already mentioned
in the late 1980s (Ryan 1988), it took Thompson’s time series (Thompson et al.
2004) to raise public awareness of the widespread presence of microplastics,
which are used in industrial production processes, cosmetics and toothpaste or
generated through degradation of larger items. Indeed, substantial concentrations
of microplastics were recently reported from remote and presumably unspoiled
environments such as the deep seafloor (Woodall et al. 2014) and Arctic sea ice,
which is considered a historic global sink at least until its plastic load is released
into the ocean during the projected increase of ice melts (Obbard et al. 2014).
Microplastics are available for ingestion by a wide range of organisms, and there
are indications that microplastics are propagated over trophic levels of the marine
food web (Farrell and Nelson 2013; Setälä et al. 2014). However, scientists have
only recently started to investigate whether the contamination of marine organisms with plastics and associated chemicals is causing harm to ecosystems and
human health (Browne et al. 2013; Bakir et al. 2014; De Witte et al. 2014; Van
Cauwenberghe and Janssen 2014).

The accumulation of litter at sea and along coastlines worldwide and the many
open questions concerning the amount, distribution and fate of marine litter and
potential implications for marine wildlife and humans have raised public awareness,
stimulated scientific research and initiated political action to tackle this environmental
problem (UNEP 2014). Identification, quantification and sampling of marine litter do
not necessarily require professional scientific skills so that NGOs as well as committed citizens and other stakeholders have contributed substantially to the collection of
data on marine litter pollution and to the global perception of the problem (Rosevelt
et al. 2013; Anderson and Alford 2014; Smith and Edgar 2014). Scientists, politicians,
authorities, NGOs and industries have started to share knowledge at international
conferences aimed at developing managerial solutions. These joint activities, public
awareness and, finally, the scientific curiosity of numerous committed researchers
have stimulated a rapidly increasing number of publications from various scientific
disciplines in dedicated volumes (Coe and Rogers 1997; Thompson et al. 2009). This
latest volume on Marine Anthropogenic Litter was inspired by the remarkable recent
progress in marine litter research. A large proportion of the references reviewed in
this book was published in the last three years demonstrating the topicality of this
book and the issue as a whole. Because of the high dynamics in this field of research,
this volume may already be outdated when published.
This book consists of five major sections. In the first section, Peter Ryan gives
a historical synopsis of marine litter research starting from the first mention of
floating debris in the famous novel 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea by Jules Verne
in 1870 but with a focus on the past 50 years, which have seen a strong increase
in the production of plastics. The reader will learn about the rapid development
of this research field, and a series of international key conferences such as the
“Honolulu Conferences”, which brought together scientists, environmentalists,
industry, NGOs and policy makers and fuelled numerous publications and new
research and management schemes.
The second section of the book addresses abiotic aspects of marine litter pollution. François Galgani, Georg Hanke and Thomas Maes portray the abundance,
global distribution and composition of marine litter, which illustrates the ubiquity of litter in the oceans from the urban centres of human activity to the Earth’s
remotest sites. Anthony L. Andrady describes the physical and chemical processes
involved in the degradation of plastics in the marine environment.
The third section of the book covers the biological and ecological implications
of marine litter. Susanne Kühn, Elisa L. Bravo Rebolledo and Jan A. van Franeker
summarize the deleterious effects of litter on marine wildlife. The authors compiled an extensive list of 580 species, ranging from invertebrates to fish, turtles,
birds and mammals that have been shown to suffer from the effects of marine
litter. Toxicity of contaminants associated with marine plastic debris as well as
health implications is described by Chelsea Rochman who demonstrates that plastics are more than a mechanic threat to marine biota. Tim Kiessling, Lars Gutow
and Martin Thiel show how marine litter facilitates the dispersal of marine organisms, which are capable of colonizing litter items floating at the sea surface. The
authors compiled a list of 387 taxa that have been found rafting on floating litter,


-----

and they evaluate how marine litter might facilitate the spread of invasive species.
This may alter the face of biodiversity with yet unknown consequences for ecosystem functioning.
The fourth section of this book is dedicated entirely to the young but rapidly
expanding field of microplastic research. Since the recent rise in public awareness
of microplastics in the marine environment, intensive research on this topic has
yielded a considerable amount of important scientific results. Accordingly, this
topic deserves an entire section, which is introduced by a synopsis of microplastic research by Richard C. Thompson. The various primary and secondary sources
of microplastics and the pathways through the environment to the biota are outlined by Mark A. Browne who also highlights the need for hypothesis-driven
approaches in microplastic research. Because of the small size and the diversity of
plastic polymers, the detection, proper identification and quantification of microplastics are challenging, which hampers the comparability of results from different studies. Therefore, Martin G.J. Löder and Gunnar Gerdts composed a critical
appraisal of methods and procedures applied in this field including a case study
that demonstrates how improper methodology easily leads to a misevaluation of
the contamination of habitats and organisms. The global distribution and the environmental effects of microplastics are summarized by Amy Lusher. She compiled
a list of 172 taxa, which have been found to ingest microplastics either in the field
(131) or in laboratory experiments (46) with variable effects on the behavior and
health status of the organisms.
Although deleterious effects of microplastics have been demonstrated for a
considerable number of marine organisms, the role of these particles as vectors
for chemicals from the environment to the organisms is subject to intense debate.
Albert A. Koelmans used a modeling approach to critically evaluate the transfer
of environmental contaminants to marine organisms. Nanoparticles are of even
smaller particle size (<1 µm). They are of particular concern as they are more
likely to pass biological membranes and affect the functioning of cells including
blood cells and photosynthesis. Albert A. Koelmans, Ellen Besseling and Won J.
Shim summarize what little is known about this litter fraction, whose significance
in the marine environment is just coming to light.
The final section of this book moves away from natural science towards the
socio-economic implications of marine anthropogenic litter. Tamara S. Galloway
reviews the current knowledge on how chemicals associated with plastics may
affect human health. As top consumers of ocean-based food webs, humans likely
accumulate contaminants, which may compromise fecundity, reproduction and
other somatic processes. The accumulation of litter in the oceans can be considered a result of market failure on land. The root of the problem is probably—as so
often—that producers/manufacturers of goods (plastics) are not economically held
responsible for the products they sell. Stephanie Newman, Emma Watkins, Andrew
Farmer, Patrick ten Brink and Jean-Pierre Schweitzer describe economic instruments that were used in different parts of the world to reduce litter inputs to the
sea. Although a number of international policies have been in place for quite some
time to manage the input of litter to the sea, their shortcomings make them unlikely


-----

to result in significant reductions of marine litter (Gold et al. 2013). Chung-Ling
Chen describes and assesses key multilateral and national regulative measures
with respect to their sufficiency to tackle marine litter pollution. Another way to
reduce the input of litter to the ocean is suasion of citizens and stakeholders, which
requires public awareness of the problem through education and outreach activities
(Hartley et al. 2015). Ideally, such initiatives also generate data that can be used for
assessments of marine litter pollution and distribution. In the last chapter, Valeria
Hidalgo-Ruz and Martin Thiel review the potential of “citizen science” initiatives
for supporting research on this global environmental issue.
The solution of the marine litter problem requires expertise from various sectors, including industries, science, policy, authorities, NGOs and citizens. We hope
that this book will facilitate the exchange of knowledge amongst the various actors
and contribute to finding solutions to this challenge.

**Chapter 1**
## A Brief History of Marine Litter Research

**Peter G. Ryan**

**Abstract This chapter traces the history of marine litter research from anecdotal**
reports of entanglement and plastic ingestion in the 1960s to the current focus
on microplastics and their role in the transfer of persistent organic pollutants to
marine food webs. The reports in _Science of large numbers of plastic pellets in_
the North Atlantic in the early 1970s stimulated research interest in plastic litter
at sea, with papers reporting plastics on the seafloor and impacting a variety of
marine animals. The focus then shifted to high concentrations of plastic litter in
the North Pacific, where novel studies reported the dynamics of stranded beach
litter, the factors influencing plastic ingestion by seabirds, and trends in fur seal
entanglement. By the early 1980s, growing concern about the potential impacts
of marine litter resulted in a series of meetings on marine debris. The first two
international conferences held in Honolulu by the US National Marine Fisheries
Service played a key role in setting the research agenda for the next decade. By
the end of the 1980s, most impacts of marine litter were reasonably well understood, and attention shifted to seeking effective solutions to tackle the marine litter
problem. Research was largely restricted to monitoring trends in litter to assess
the effectiveness of mitigation measures, until the last decade, when concern about
microplastics coupled with the discovery of alarming densities of small plastic
particles in the North Pacific ‘garbage patch’ (and other mid-ocean gyres) stimulated the current wave of research.

**1.1 Introduction**

From messages in bottles to exotic tropical seeds washing up on temperate shores
(Guppy 1917; Muir 1937), the dispersal of floating debris at sea has long fascinated people. As early as 1870 Jules Verne provided a graphic description of
how floating debris accumulates in ocean gyres in the chapter on the Sargasso
Sea in his famous novel Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea. However, this
review focuses on the last 50 years because from the perspective of environmental
impacts the history of marine litter research is closely linked to the development of
plastics. Plastics are a diverse group of synthetic polymers that have their origins
in the late 19th century, but which really came to the fore in the mid-twentieth
century. Their low density, durability, excellent barrier properties and relatively
low cost make plastics ideal materials for a wide range of manufacturing and
packaging applications. Their versatility has seen the amount of plastic produced
annually increase rapidly over the last few decades to an estimated 288 million
tonnes in 2012 (Fig. 1.1), and this total continues to grow at about 4 % per year
(PlasticsEurope 2013). However, the properties that make plastics so useful also
make inappropriately handled waste plastics a significant environmental threat.
Their durability means that they persist in the environment for many years, and
their low density means that they are readily dispersed by water and wind, sometimes travelling thousands of kilometres from source areas (Ryan et al. 2009). As a
result, plastic wastes are now ubiquitous pollutants in even the most remote areas
of the world (Barnes et al. 2009).
Over the last 60 years we have seen a major shift in perception surrounding
the use of plastics, especially in one-off applications. Once seen as the savior of
the American housewife (Life Magazine 1955), there are now calls to treat waste
plastics as hazardous materials (Rochman et al. 2013a), reiterating a point first
made by Bean (1987) that persistent plastic wastes qualify as hazardous wastes
under the US Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Most of the threats posed
by plastics occur at sea (Gregory 2009; Thompson et al. 2009), where waste
plastics tend to accumulate (Barnes et al. 2009; Ryan et al. 2009). This chapter
briefly summarises the history of marine litter research. Trends in the numbers of

intervals over the last 50 years (based on a Web of Science search and unpublished bibliography;
note that the final column only covers three years, 2011–2013)


papers on the marine litter problem (Fig. 1.2) show the growth in research from its
infancy in the late 1960s, when it was still treated largely as a curiosity, through
the 1970s and 1980s, when most of the threats to marine systems were identified,
baseline data were collected on the distribution, abundance and impacts of marine
litter, and policies were formulated to tackle the problem. Research tapered off in
the 1990s, despite ongoing increases in the amounts of marine litter (Ryan and
Moloney 1990, 1993), and it is only in the last decade or so that there has been a
resurgence in research interest, following alarming reports of mid-ocean ‘garbage
patches’ (Moore et al. 2001) and increasing appreciation of the pervasive nature
of very small ‘microplastic’ particles (<0.5 mm) and their potential impacts on the
health of marine ecosystems (Oehlmann et al. 2009; Thompson et al. 2009).

**1.2 Seabirds and Seals—The First Signs of Trouble**


Interactions between marine organisms and persistent litter were first recorded in
the scientific literature in the late 1960s, when Kenyon and Kridler (1969) reported
the ingestion of plastic items by Laysan Albatrosses (Phoebastria immutabilis) on
the northwest Hawaiian Islands. They found plastic in the stomachs of 74 of 100
albatross chicks that died prior to fledging in 1966, with up to 8 items and an average of 2 g plastic per bird. However, this was an order of magnitude less than the
average mass of pumice, seeds, charcoal and wood that the chicks also were fed


-----

by their parents. Kenyon and Kridler (1969) inferred that these indigestible items
were swallowed inadvertently at sea, because virtually all items floated in seawater. They also speculated that the large size of many of the items might have contributed to the chicks’ deaths by blocking their digestive tracts.
In fact, there were earlier records of seabirds ingesting plastics, with plastic found in stranded prions (Pachyptila spp.) in New Zealand as early as 1960
(Harper and Fowler 1987), and in Leach’s storm petrels (Oceanodroma leucorhoa)
from Newfoundland, Canada, in 1962 (Rothstein 1973). Non-breeding Atlantic
puffins (Fratercula arctica) collected from 1969 to 1971 were reported to contain
elastic threads in their stomachs (Berland 1971; Parslow and Jefferies 1972). In
some birds, these threads had formed tight balls up to 10 mm across, filling the
gizzard and possibly partially blocking the pyloric valve leading into the intestine
(Parslow and Jefferies 1972). Parslow and Jefferies (1972) noted that ingesting
rubber and elastic was common among scavenging birds such as gulls, but that
they regularly regurgitated such items along with other indigestible prey remains,
implying that this was not a problem for such birds. And it was not just seabirds at
risk. By the late 1950s there were records of marine turtles ingesting plastic bags,
sometimes resulting in their deaths (Cornelius 1975; Balazs 1985). A mass of
fishing line and other fishing gear blocked the intestine of a manatee (Trichechus
_manatus) in 1974 (Forrester et al._ 1975), and stranded cetaceans were found to
have eaten plastic by the mid-1970s (Cawthorn 1985).
Records of entanglement of marine organisms in plastic litter also started to
increase in the 1960s. There were reports of birds and seals entangled in man-made
items before this (e.g. Jacobson 1947), but they tended to remain in the gray literature (Fowler 1985; Wallace 1985). By 1964 northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus)
were often reported entangled in netting and other artefacts in the Bering Sea, and
the incidence of entangled seals harvested in the Pribilof Islands showed a steady
increase from less than 0.2 % of the population in 1967 to a peak of over 0.7 % in
1975 (Fowler 1987). The entanglement rate then stabilized at around 0.4 % through
the late 1970s and early 1980s (Fig. 1.3), but this was still sufficient to help to drive
a population decrease in this species (Fowler 1987; Fowler et al. 1990). By comparison, entanglement rates of three seal species at the Farallon Islands off central
California showed a marked increase in the early 1980s (Hanni and Pyle 2000).

Entanglement of fish and dogfish in rubber bands was reported in 1971 (Anon

1971; Berland 1971), and Gochfeld (1973) highlighted the entanglement threat
posed by marine litter to coastal birds. Based on observations on Long Island in
1970 and 1971, Gochfeld (1973) reported how adult and chick black skimmers
(Rhynchops niger) and two species of terns died after being entangled in nylon
fishing line, kite strings, six-pack holders, bags and bottles. Although the numbers
of birds affected were not great, Gochfeld (1973) argued that they might be sufficient to cause at least some populations to decrease, especially when combined
with other human impacts in the region. Subsequently, Bourne (1976, 1977) summarised what was known about the threat posed by plastic ingestion and entanglement to seabirds, and reported how the incorporation of rope and netting in seabird
nests can entangle and kill seabird chicks. He also highlighted the threat posed by
the switch to manufacturing nets and other fishing gear from persistent polymers,
including ghost fishing by lost or discarded gear (Bourne 1977). Entanglement
was a significant cause of mortality for northern gannets (Morus bassanus),
affecting roughly a quarter of birds found dead in the North Sea in the 1980s
(Schrey and Vauk 1987), and remains a problem for this species today (Rodríguez
et al. 2013).

**1.3 The Early 1970s—Pellets and Other Problems**
**in the North Atlantic**

Many of these early records of ingestion and entanglement only came to light after
two seminal papers on the occurrence of plastic particles at sea in the northwest
Atlantic Ocean appeared in the leading journal Science in 1972. In the first paper,
Carpenter and Smith (1972) reported the presence of plastic pellets and fragments
in all 11 surface net samples collected in the western Sargasso Sea in late 1971,
at an average density of around 3500 particles km[−][2] (290 g km[−][2]). Interestingly,
the density of plastic was lowest towards the edge of the Sargasso Sea, where it
bordered the Gulf Stream, suggesting that these particles had been accumulating
in the North Atlantic gyre for some time (cf. Law et al. 2010; Lebreton et al. 2012;
Maximenko et al. 2012). Carpenter and Smith (1972) noted that the plastic particles provided attachment sites for epibionts, including hydroids and diatoms, and
speculated that such particles could become a significant problem if plastic production continued to increase. They also suggested that plastic particles could be
a source of toxic compounds such as plasticisers and polychlorinated biphenyls
(PCBs) into marine food webs.
In the second paper, Carpenter et al. (1972) reported high densities of polystyrene pellets in coastal waters off southern New England, east of Long Island
(average 0.0–2.6 pellets m[−][3], exceptionally reaching 14 pellets m[−][3]). Polystyrene
is denser than seawater, so the pellets were not expected to disperse far from
source areas, but some contained air-filled vacuoles, allowing them to float. The
pellets supported communities of bacteria, and were found to have absorbed


-----

polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) from seawater. Pellets were recorded in the
stomachs of eight of 14 fish species and one chaetognath (Sagitta elegans) sampled in the area. The fish ignored translucent pellets, only eating opaque white
pellets, which suggested selective feeding on the more visible pellets. With up to
33 % of individuals of some fish species affected, Carpenter et al. (1972) raised
concerns about the possible impacts due to intestinal blockage of smaller individuals as well as pellets being a source of PCBs.
In fact, Carpenter’s two _Science papers were not the first papers to describe_
small pieces of plastic litter at sea. Buchanan (1971) reported densities of up to
10[5] synthetic fibres m[−][3] in water samples from the North Sea, and larger fragments were reported to occur in “embarrassing proportions” in plankton samples.
And although Heyerdahl (1971) mainly concentrated on oil and tar pollution, he
reported sightings of plastic containers throughout the second Ra expedition across
the North Atlantic. However, Carpenter’s papers focused scientific attention on the
ubiquitous nature of small plastic particle pollution at sea, and identified three possible impacts: intestinal blockage and a source of toxic compounds from ingested
plastic, and the transport of epibionts.
Following Carpenter et al. (1972), large numbers of polystyrene pellets were
reported from coastal waters in the United Kingdom (Kartar et al. 1973, 1976;
Morris and Hamilton 1974) where they were ingested by three species of fish and a
marine snailfish (Liparis liparis). More than 20 % of juvenile flounder (Platichthys
_flesus) contained ingested plastics, with up to 30 pellets in some individuals. Hays_
and Cormons (1974) found polystyrene pellets in gull and tern regurgitations collected on Long Island, New York, in 1971. Although the gulls may have consumed
the plastic pellets directly while scavenging, their presence in the diet of terns
almost certainly indicated that they were consumed in contaminated fish prey, providing the first evidence of trophic transfers of small plastic items. Sampling close
to wastewater outfalls confirmed that the pellets came from plastic manufacturing plants (Hays and Cormons 1974). Fortunately, these point sources were fairly
easy to identify and address. By 1975 the incidence of plastic ingestion by fish and
snails in the UK’s Severn Estuary had fallen to zero, indicating that the release
of polystyrene pellets had virtually ceased from the manufacturing plants (Kartar
et al. 1976). However, spillage of pellets by converters and during transport proved
more difficult to contain.
Carpenter’s two Science papers in 1972 stimulated a broader interest in marine
litter and its impacts. Colton et al. (1974) reported a much more extensive survey of floating plastics in the North Atlantic and Caribbean. They showed that
both industrial pellets and fragments of manufactured items occurred throughout
the region, but were concentrated close to major land-based sources along the US
eastern seaboard. Unlike Carpenter et al. (1972), they failed to find any plastics
in fish sampled. Feeding trials with polystyrene pellets showed that juvenile fish
seldom ingested plastics, and those pellets that were ingested seemingly passed
through the fish with little impact.
Beach litter also came under increased scrutiny. Scott (1972) debunked the
notion that beach users were responsible for most litter. He examined the litter


-----

found on inaccessible Scottish beaches that have few if any visitors, and inferred
that most litter came from shipping and fisheries operating in the area. Initial studies of beach litter simply assessed standing stocks (Ryan et al. 2009); Cundell
(1973) was the first researcher to report the rate of plastic accumulation. Working
on a beach in Narragansett Bay, USA, he assessed the amount of litter washing
ashore over one month. The first study of beach litter dynamics was conducted in
Kent, United Kingdom, from 1973 to 1976. Dixon and Cooke (1977) showed that
the weekly retention rate of marked bottles and other containers varied depending on the type of beach, and that plastic bottles remained on beaches longer than
glass bottles. Strong tidal currents resulted in low retention rates (11–29 % per
week) and transported litter throughout the southern North Sea. Some marked bottles travelled >100 km in one week, and others reached Germany and Denmark
within 3–6 weeks. Dixon and Cooke (1977) also used manufacturer’s codes to
assess the longevity of containers and found that few (<20 %) were manufactured
more than two years prior to stranding.
In addition to the growing awareness of plastic litter at the sea surface and
stranded on beaches, the mid-1970s also saw the first records of plastics on the
seabed. Holmström (1975) reported how Swedish fishermen “almost invariably”
caught plastic sheets in their trawl nets when fishing in the Skagerrak. Subsequent
analysis showed this to be low-density polyethylene, similar to that used for packaging. The samples, obtained from the seabed 180–400 m deep, were encrusted
with a calcareous bryozoan and a brown alga (Lithoderma sp.). Holmström (1975)
surmised that these encrusting biota had increased the density of the plastic sheets
sufficiently to cause them to sink to the seabed. The bryozoan and brown alga
typically occur in water <25 m deep, and the size of bryozoan colonies suggested
that the plastic sheets had spent 3–4 months drifting in the euphotic zone close
to the sea surface before sinking to the seabed. Subsequent trials confirmed that
most plastics sink due to fouling (Ye and Andrady 1991), and trawl surveys and
direct observations have confirmed that plastics and other persistent artefacts now
occur on the seabed throughout the world’s oceans (Barnes et al. 2009). Indeed,
Goldberg (1994, 1997) suggested that the seabed is the ultimate sink for plastics
in the environment, and plastic items typically comprise >70 % of seabed artefacts (Galgani et al. 2000). The Mediterranean Sea supports particularly high
densities of litter on the seafloor, locally exceeding 100,000 items km[−][2], and has
been the subject of numerous studies to ascertain the factors determining the distribution and abundance of this litter (e.g. Bingel et al. 1987; Galil et al. 1995;
Galgani et al. 1995, 1996). Interestingly, although benthic litter tends to concentrate around coastal cities and river mouths, the density of litter is often greater in
deep waters along the continental shelf edge than in shallow, inshore waters due to
the decrease in bottom currents offshore (Galgani et al. 1995, 2000; Barnes et al.
2009; Keller et al. 2010).
Winston (1982) elaborated on Carpenter and Smith’s (1972) suggestion that
plastic debris greatly increased settlement opportunities for organisms that live
on objects floating at the sea surface. In particular, the bryozoan _Electra tenella_
appeared to have extended its range and greatly increased in abundance in the


-----

western Atlantic Ocean. Subsequent research has highlighted the potential threat
posed by drifting litter transporting organisms outside their native ranges (Barnes
2002; Barnes and Milner 2005; Gregory 2009). This is a serious problem, especially in remote regions, and can result in the transfer of potentially harmful
organisms (Masó et al. 2003). However, it probably pales into insignificance in
most regions compared to the transport by shipping and other human-mediated
vectors (Bax et al. 2003), which in extreme cases can transfer entire communities
across ocean basins (Wanless et al. 2010).

**1.4 Shifting Focus to the North Pacific Ocean**

Indications that the North Pacific was a hot spot for plastic litter date back to
Kenyon and Kridler’s (1969) paper on plastic ingestion by Laysan ­albatross.
Subsequently, Bond (1971) found plastic pellets in all 20 red phalaropes
(Phalaropus fulicarius) examined when many individuals of this species came
ashore along the coasts of southern California and Mexico in 1969. The birds
apparently starved due to a shortage of surface plankton, and some were observed
feeding along the strand line where plastic pellets were abundant (Bond 1971). It
was unclear whether this had contributed to the high incidence of plastic in these
birds, but Connors and Smith (1982) found plastic in six of seven red ­phalaropes
killed by colliding with powerlines on their northward migration in central
California. Birds with large volumes of ingested plastic had smaller fat reserves,
raising concerns that ingested plastic reduced digestive efficiency or meal size.
Baltz and Morejohn (1976) reported plastic in nine species of seabirds stranded
in Monterey Bay, central California, during 1974–1975. All individuals of two
species contained plastic: northern fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis) and short-tailed
shearwater (Puffinus tenuirostris). Industrial pellets predominated in these birds,
but they were also found to contain pieces of food wrap, foamed polystyrene,
synthetic sponge and pieces of rigid plastic. Baltz and Morejohn (1976) speculated that having large volumes of plastic in their stomachs could interfere with
the birds’ digestion, although they considered that toxic chemicals adsorbed to the
plastics posed the greatest threat to bird health. Ohlendorf et al. (1978) showed
that plastic ingestion also occurred among Alaskan seabirds.
In the same year that Colton et al. (1974) showed the ubiquitous nature of
plastic particles floating in the northwest Atlantic, Wong et al. (1974) reported
that plastic pellets were widespread in the North Pacific Ocean. Sampling in
1972, they found that pellets occurred at lower densities (average 300 g km[−][2])
than tar balls, but they outnumbered tar balls northeast of Hawaii, with up to
34,000 pellets km[−][2] (3500 g km[−][2]). Even before this, however, Venrick et al.
(1973) had shown that large litter items, at least half of which were made of
plastic, were commonly encountered in the North Pacific gyre northeast of
Hawaii (roughly 4.2 items km[−][2]) in the area of the now notorious ‘North Pacific
Garbage Patch’. This is where Moore et al. (2001) recorded densities of more than


-----

300,000 particles km[−][2] in 1999, and where the weight of the plastic was six times
that of the associated zooplankton.
Merrell (1980) conducted one of the first detailed studies of beach litter. Working
on remote Alaskan beaches, he reported how the amount of plastic litter more than
doubled in abundance between 1972 and 1974, increasing from an average density
of 122 to 345 kg km[−][1]. Most of this litter came from fisheries operating in the area,
but some apparently had drifted more than 1500 km from Asia. At the same time,
Jewett (1976) and Feder et al. (1978) found that litter was common on the seabed
off Alaska, with plastic items predominating. Merrell (1980) considered that the
most obvious impact of beach litter was its aesthetic impact. In terms of biological
threats, he speculated that plastic litter might account for the elevated levels of PCBs
recorded in rats and intertidal organisms on Amchitka Island, and also suggested that
plastics might be a source of phthalates and other toxic compounds into marine systems. Litter also entangled animals, especially seals and seabirds (Merrell 1980), and
even terrestrial species were not immune from this problem (Beach et al. 1976).
Merrell (1980) reported the first long-term study of litter accumulation from a
1-km beach on Amchitka Island, Aleutians. He showed that the accumulation rate
of litter (average 0.9 kg km[−][1] d[−][1]) varied considerably between sample periods
(0.6–2.3 kg km[−][1] d[−][1]), and at a fine temporal scale the amount of litter stranded
was a function of recent weather conditions. He also estimated the annual turnover
rate of plastic items on the beach by marking gillnet floats, the most abundant litter item on the island, in two successive years. During the intervening year, 41 %
of marked floats disappeared (25 % at one beach and 70 % at another beach), but
this loss was more than compensated for by new arrivals, with a net increase of
130 %. Merrell (1980) discussed the various factors causing the loss of plastic
items from beaches (burial, export inland or out to sea, etc.), and noted the bias
introduced by selective beachcombing. Even on remote Amchitka Island, the small
Atomic Energy Commission workforce removed certain types of fishing floats
within a few days of the floats washing ashore.
The large amounts of litter found in Alaska, coupled with ingestion by seabirds
(Ohlendorf et al. 1978) and entanglement of seals (Fowler 1985, 1987), stimulated
the first post-graduate thesis on the marine litter problem. Bob Day (1980) studied the amounts of plastic ingested by Alaskan seabirds, in the first communitylevel study of plastic ingestion. Of the almost 2000 birds from 37 species collected
off Alaska from 1969 to 1977, plastic was found in 40 % of species and 23 % of
individuals. His main findings were presented in a review paper at the first marine
debris conference in 1984 that summarized what was known about plastic ingestion by birds (Day et al. 1985). By that stage, it was clear that the incidence of
plastic ingestion varied greatly among taxa, with high rates typically recorded
among petrels and shearwaters (Procellariidae), phalaropes (Phalaropus) and
some auks (Alcidae). Unsurprisingly, generalist foragers that fed near the water
surface tended to have the highest plastic loads, although some pursuit-diving
shearwaters and auks also contained large amounts of plastic. Plastic items were
only found in the stomachs of birds; no visible items passed into the intestines.
There was some evidence that at least some species retained plastic particles in


-----

their stomachs for considerable periods (up to 15 months), where they slowly
eroded. Almost all particles floated in seawater, and comparison of the colors of
ingested plastics with observations of the colors of litter items at sea demonstrated
that all species favoured more conspicuous items, suggesting they were consumed
deliberately. Industrial pellets comprised the majority of plastic items in most species sampled, possibly due to their similarity to fish eggs.
Day et al. (1985) also showed that the incidence of plastic ingestion generally
increased over the study period, but patterns were affected by seasonal and agerelated differences in plastic loads. Sex had no effect on plastic loads, but immature birds contained more plastic than adults in two of three species where this
could be tested. There were also regional differences in plastic loads, with birds
from the Aleutian Islands containing more plastic than birds from the Gulf of
Alaska, and even lower loads in birds from the Bering and Chukchi Seas. Surveys
in the North Atlantic confirmed regional differences in plastic loads in northern
fulmars (Bourne 1976; Furness 1985a; van Franeker 1985), paving the way for the
use of this species to monitor the abundance and distribution of plastic litter at sea
(Ryan et al. 2009; van Franeker et al. 2011; Kühn and van Franeker 2012).
Like Connors and Smith (1982), Day (1980) found weak negative correlations between the amount of ingested plastic and body mass or fat reserves in
some species, suggesting a sub-lethal effect on birds. And among parakeet auklets
(Cyclorrhynchus psittacula), non-breeding adults contained twice as much plastic
as breeding adults. However, Day (1980) was quick to point out that the differences in plastic loads could be a consequence of poor body condition or breeding
status rather than vice versa. Harper and Fowler (1987) assumed that the negative correlation between the amount of ingested plastic and body mass of juvenile Salvin’s prions (Pachyptila salvini) stranded in New Zealand in 1966 resulted
from starving birds resorting to eat inedible objects such as pumice and plastic
pellets. Spear et al. (1995) reported that among a large series of birds collected in
the tropical Pacific, heavier birds were more likely to contain plastic, and attributed this to the fact that they fed in productive frontal areas where plastic tends
to accumulate (cf. Bourne and Clarke 1984). Among birds that contained plastic,
there was a negative correlation between the amount of plastic and body weight,
which they interpreted as providing the first solid evidence of a negative relationship between plastic ingestion and body condition (Spear et al. 1995). However,
caution must be exercised in such comparisons, given the effects of age and breeding status on the amounts of plastic in seabirds such as petrels that regurgitate
accumulated plastic to their chicks (Ryan 1988a).

**1.5 Into the Southern Hemisphere**

Despite the fact that the first record of plastic ingestion came from the Southern
Hemisphere in 1960 (Harper and Fowler 1987), reports of the occurrence of plastics at sea in the Southern Hemisphere generally lagged somewhat behind that


-----

in the north. Notable exceptions were the reports of plastic ingestion by turtles
in South Africa, where plastic pellets were found in juvenile loggerhead turtles
(Caretta caretta) in 1968 (Hughes 1970) and a large sheet of plastic was found
blocking the intestine of a leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) that died in
1970 (Hughes 1974). The paucity of records of plastic litter from the Southern
Hemisphere did not mean that the problem was not as severe in the less industrialized south. Gregory (1977, 1978) reported plastic pellets from virtually all
New Zealand beaches, with densities at some beaches estimated at >100,000 pellets m[−][1], which probably are the highest estimates of industrial pellet densities
from any beach. Quite why such high densities were found in a country with a
relatively small manufacturing base is unclear. Plastic pellets were also recorded
in oceanic waters of the South Atlantic off the Cape in 1979, an area far removed
from major shipping lanes and with little industrial activity in adjacent coastal
regions (Morris 1980). There was a suggestion that pellets were more abundant
west of 12°E (1500–3600 km[−][2]) than closer to the Cape coast (0–2000 km[−][2]),
possibly linked to their aggregation in the South Atlantic gyre (cf. Lebreton et al.
2012; Maximenko et al. 2012; Ryan 2014). However, the average density of pellets and other plastic fragments close to the Cape coast was more than 3600 particles km[−][2] (Ryan 1988b), similar to densities reported in oceanic waters of the
North Atlantic (Carpenter and Smith 1972; Colton et al. 1974) and North Pacific
(Wong et al. 1974). By comparison, the density of pellets and other plastic litter
in sub-Antarctic waters south of New Zealand was very low (<100 items km[−][2],
Gregory et al. 1984).
In addition to plastic pellet ingestion by New Zealand prions since the 1960s
(Harper and Fowler 1987), rubber bands were found in Antarctic fulmars
(Fulmarus glacialoides) stranded on New Zealand beaches in 1975 (Crockett and
Reed 1976), and during an irruption of Southern Ocean petrels to New Zealand
in 1981 all blue petrels (Halobaena caerulea) but very few Kerguelen petrels
(Lugensa brevirostris) contained plastic (Reed 1981). Subsequent studies confirmed the high levels of plastic in blue petrels, despite the species rarely foraging north of the Subtropical Convergence (Ryan 1987a). Sampling in 1981 also
showed that at least three petrel species collected in the South Atlantic Ocean
contained plastics (Bourne and Imber 1982; Furness 1983; Randall et al. 1983).
The incidence was greatest in great shearwaters (Puffinus gravis), with 90 % of
individuals of this trans-equatorial migrant containing plastic particles, sometimes
in large volumes (up to 78 pellets and fragments; Furness 1983). Further surveys
even found plastics in Antarctic seabirds, but they were scarce in species that
remained south of the Antarctic Polar Front year round compared to migrants that
ventured farther north in the non-breeding season (Ryan 1987a; van Franeker and
Bell 1988). Beach litter surveys confirmed the presence of plastic wastes in the far
south, although the amounts of litter decreased from south temperate to sub-Antarctic and Antarctic locations (Gregory et al. 1984; Gregory 1987; Ryan 1987b).
Bob Furness (1985b) reported the first systematic survey of plastic ingestion
by Southern Hemisphere birds for the seabirds of Gough Island, central South
Atlantic Ocean. Of the 15 species sampled, 10 contained plastic, and two species


-----

had plastic in more than 80 % of individuals sampled. Petrels were again the most
affected species, and Furness (1985b) was able to show that this was linked to the
structure of their stomachs. The angled constriction between the fore-stomach
and gizzard apparently prevents petrels regurgitating indigestible prey remains
(except when feeding their chicks). Once again body mass was inversely correlated with the amount of ingested plastic in some species, but Furness (1985b)
highlighted the need for controlled experiments to demonstrate an adverse impact
of plastic ingestion. Building on this study, Ryan (1987a) showed that 40 of 60
Southern Hemisphere seabird species ingested plastic. Controlling for age and
breeding status there was no correlation between plastic load and body condition
(Ryan 1987c), but there was a correlation with PCB concentrations (Ryan et al.
1988), and chicks experimentally fed plastic grew more slowly than control birds,
because they ate smaller meals (Ryan 1988c). A subsequent experiment showed
that marine turtle hatchlings did not increase their food intake sufficiently to offset
dietary dilution by an inert substance used to mimic the presence of plastic in their
diet (McCauley and Bjorndal 1999).
Although most plastic apparently was ingested directly by the marine vertebrates studied, there was some evidence of secondary ingestion. Eriksson and
Burton (2003) collected plastic particles from fur seal scat on Macquarie Island
and speculated that they were ingested by lantern fish (Electrona subaspera),
which were then eaten by the seals. And ingestion was not the only issue reported
from the Southern Hemisphere. During the 1970s the rates of entanglement of
Cape fur seals (Arctocephalus pusillus) in southern Africa (Shaughnessy 1980)
were similar to those of northern fur seals in Alaska. The first entangled New
Zealand fur seal (Arctocephalus forsteri) was observed in 1975 (Cawthorn 1985),
and by the late 1970s entanglements of fur seals were recorded as far south as
South Georgia (Bonner and McCann 1982). The first entanglements of cetaceans
and sharks also were recorded from New Zealand in the 1970s (Cawthorn 1985).

**1.6 Aloha—The Marine Debris Conferences**

The growing awareness of the accumulation of plastic wastes in marine systems,
and their impacts on marine biota, resulted in the Marine Mammal Commission
approaching the US National Marine Fisheries Service in 1982 to arrange a workshop on the issue. Given the severity of the problem in the North Pacific Ocean,
the task devolved to the Southwest Fisheries Center’s Honolulu Laboratory. The
Workshop on the Fate and Impact of Marine Debris took place in late November
1984 and was attended by 125 people from eight countries (91 % from the USA,
4 % from Asia, 3 % from Europe and 1 % each from Canada and New Zealand).
Given the geographic bias of delegates, most of the 31 papers dealt with the North
Pacific, but there were more general papers on the distribution and dynamics of
floating litter as well as reviews of entanglement (Wallace 1985), and ingestion by
seabirds (Day et al. 1985). The 580-page proceedings, edited by Richard Shomura


-----

and Howard Yoshida, appeared laudably fast as a NOAA Technical Memorandum
in July 1985. Papers presented at the workshop were divided into three themes: the
origins and amounts of marine debris (12 papers), impacts on marine resources
(13 papers), and its fate (4 papers). The proceedings concluded with summary
documents from working groups addressing each of the three main themes. The
workshop emphasized the need to raise awareness of the threat posed by marine
litter, and recommended three mitigation initiatives: to regulate the disposal of
high-risk plastic items, to promote recycling of fishing nets, and to investigate the
use of biodegradable material in fishing gear.
The success of the first marine debris workshop led to plans for a Second
International Conference on Marine Debris. However, before this could occur
the Sixth International Ocean Disposal Symposium took place in Pacific Grove,
California, in April 1986. This was the first symposium in this series to address
the dumping of persistent plastic wastes (Wolfe 1987). It was attended by 160
delegates from 10 countries and resulted in a special issue of _Marine Pollution_
_Bulletin (1987, volume 18, issue 6B). The focus was largely on ship-based sources_
of marine debris and their impacts, but also addressed incidental bycatch in fishing
gear as well as land-based sources of debris. A few papers were repeated from the
1984 Honolulu workshop, and apart from Pruter’s (1987) review of litter sources
and amounts and Laist’s (1987) review of the biological impacts of marine plastics, two of the most important papers dealt with legal approaches and strategies to
reduce the amount of plastic entering the sea (Bean 1987; Lentz 1987).
The Second International Conference on Marine Debris was again held in
Honolulu in April 1989, attracting over 170 delegates from 10 countries (USA
83 %, Japan 6 %, Canada and New Zealand 3 % each, UK 2 %; all other countries <1 %). It had a more ambitious scope than the first conference, with seven
themed sessions following a series of regional overview papers. Whereas the focus
of the first meeting was largely on the amounts and impacts of debris, the second
conference concentrated more on tackling the problem, with sessions on solutions
through technology, law and policy, and education, as well as the first estimates
of the economic costs of marine litter. The two-volume, 1274-page proceedings,
edited by Richard Shomura and Mary Lynne Godfrey, was again published as a
NOAA Technical Memorandum in December 1990 and contained 76 papers plus
eight working group reports. The proceedings made numerous recommendations,
including nine priority recommendations. Both the first and second conference
proceedings are available as internet downloads.
The first two Marine Debris Conferences played a major role in collating
information on the marine debris issue. The large numbers of papers in the two
proceedings resulted in a spike in publications on the subject (Fig. 1.2). Three
further conferences have taken place. The Third International Conference on
Marine Debris was held in Miami in May 1994 and had a more Caribbean flavor.
It also differed from the two earlier conferences in having only selected papers
published from the meeting in a book that aimed to provide a definitive treatment
of the marine debris problem (Coe and Rogers 1997). The theme of the conference was ‘Seeking Global Solutions’, and two-thirds of the papers were devoted


-----

to mitigation, with four chapters on the socioeconomics of marine litter, eight
chapters addressing at-sea sources, and ten chapters on land-based sources. This
reflected the increasing appreciation that not only were diffuse, land-based inputs
the major source of marine litter, but that in many ways they were harder to tackle
than ship-based sources.
The two most recent Marine Debris Conferences were again held in Honolulu.
The fourth conference (August 2000), which focused on the problems posed by
derelict fishing gear, attracted 235 people from more than 20 countries, all but
one in the Pacific region. The fifth meeting (March 2011) was the largest yet, with
more than 450 delegates from across the world, reflecting the mounting concern
among civil society regarding the threats posed by marine litter. Entitled ‘Waves
_of Change: Global Lessons to Inspire Local Action’, the conference concluded_
that despite the challenges inherent in tackling marine debris, the problem is preventable. The summary proceedings, released on the internet after the meeting,
included reports from the three working groups established to address the prevention, reduction and management of land-based sources, of at-sea sources, and the
removal and processing of accumulated marine debris. The reports highlighted
progress made in each of these areas over the last decade, identified remaining challenges, and made recommendations for future action. The conference
concluded with the Honolulu Commitment, which called on governmental and
non-governmental organisations, industry and other stakeholders to commit to
12 action points, including formulating the Honolulu Strategy to prevent, reduce
and manage marine debris. This framework document, sponsored by United
Nations Environment Programme and the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, was released in 2012.

**1.7 Mitigation Measures and Long-Term**
**Changes in Marine Litter**

One of the major challenges in addressing the marine plastics problem is the
diverse nature of plastic products, and the many routes they can follow to enter
marine systems (Pruter 1987; Ryan et al. 2009). As a result, a diversity of mitigation measures is needed to tackle the problem. Initial efforts focused on two
specific user groups, shipping/fisheries and the plastics industry, at least in
part because they are relatively discrete user groups, and thus are more easily addressed (at least in theory). Shipping was a major source of marine litter
(Scott 1972; Horsman 1982). Dumping persistent plastic wastes from land-based
sources at sea was banned under the Convention on the Prevention of Pollution by
Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter (London Dumping Convention, promulgated
in 1972; Lentz 1987), but operational wastes generated by vessels were exempt
until Annex V of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution
from Ships (MARPOL, promulagated in 1973) came into force at the end of 1988
[(www.imo.org). Since then considerable effort has been expended to ensure there](http://www.imo.org)


-----

are adequate port facilities to receive wastes from ships (Coe and Rogers 1997).
Current signatories to MARPOL Annex V are responsible for more than 97 % of
the world’s shipping tonnage, but compliance and enforcement remain significant
problems (Carpenter and MacGill 2005).
Industrial pellets were another target for early mitigation measures because
they were abundant in the environment, often ingested by marine birds and turtles, and only handled by a relatively small group of manufacturers and converters. As early as the 1970s it was clear that improving controls in manufacturing
plants could significantly reduce the numbers of pellets entering coastal waters
(Kartar et al. 1976). The loss of pellets in wastewater should fall under national
water quality control measures, but in most countries the issue has been ignored
in favour of chemical pollutants (Bean 1987). As a result, it was left to the plastics
industry to initiate efforts to reduce losses of industrial pellets such as Operation
Clean Sweep, established in the USA in 1992, and adopted in various guises by
many other plastics industry organisations around the world (Redford et al. 1997).
How effective were these measures in reducing litter entering the sea? Although
there were some exceptions (e.g. Merrell 1984), amounts of plastic litter at sea
increased up to the 1990s, and then appeared to stabilize, whereas quantities on
beaches and on the seabed have continued to increase (Barnes et al. 2009; Law
et al. 2010). This could result from a decrease in the amounts of litter entering
the sea (Barnes et al. 2009), but interpretation is complicated by the difficulty of
monitoring marine litter loads, and our rather poor understanding of the rates of
degradation and transport between habitats and regions (Ryan et al. 2009). Part of
the problem is that mitigation measures may be effective in reducing the proportion of the waste stream reaching the sea, but this decrease may be insufficient to
decrease the absolute amount of litter entering the sea, given the ongoing increase
in plastic production (Fig. 1.1).
Interaction rates with marine biota provide one way to track the impacts
of marine litter, and several studies have focused on the effects of specific mitigation initiatives. For example, the rate of entanglement in Antarctic fur seals
(Arctocephalus gazella) at South Georgia decreased over the last two decades following active steps to prevent dumping of persistent wastes by vessels operating in
the waters around the island. However, some of the decrease can be attributed to
changes in seal numbers (Arnould and Croxall 1995; Waluda and Staniland 2013).
A similar conclusion was reached by Boren et al. (2006) for New Zealand fur seals,
where the decrease in the entanglement rate after 1997 was more likely a result of
increasing seal numbers than a decrease in the amounts of litter at sea. Henderson
(2001) showed no change in entanglement rates of Hawaiian monk seals (Monachus
_schauinslandi) before and after the implementation of MARPOL Annex V, nor_
was there a decrease in the rate at which netting washed ashore at the northwest
Hawaiian Islands. Page et al. (2004) also showed no change in seal entanglement
rates in southeast Australia despite efforts by government and fishing organisations to reduce the amount of litter discarded at sea. However, beach surveys in
this region suggested that the implementation of MARPOL Annex V reduced
the amounts of litter washed ashore (Edyvane et al. 2004). Ribic et al. (2010)


-----

showed how carefully designed beach litter surveys can detect regional differences
in long-term trends in the amounts of stranded litter, with consistent trends in landand ship-based sources of litter.
Long-term studies of plastic ingestion by seabirds also indicate limited success in tackling the marine litter problem. The rapid increase in the amount of
ingested plastic through the 1960s and 1970s (Harper and Fowler 1987; Moser and
Lee 1992) stabilized during the 1980s and 1990s (Vlietstra and Parga 2002; Ryan
2008; Bond et al. 2013), but only studies of North Atlantic fulmars show a recent
decrease in the amount of ingested plastic (van Franeker et al. 2011). Although
the total amount of ingested plastic has tended to remain fairly constant over the
last few decades, there has been a marked change in the composition of ingested
plastic from pellets to plastic fragments (Vlietstra and Parga 2002; Ryan 2008;
van Franeker et al. 2011), suggesting that efforts to reduce the numbers of pellets entering the sea have been at least partly successful. These results mirror the
findings of net-samples of plastic litter at sea, which have seen a major increase in
the proportion of user fragments and a corresponding decrease in industrial pellets relative to surveys conducted in the 1970s and 1980s (Moore et al. 2001; Law
et al. 2010).

**1.8 Plastic Degradation and the Microplastic Boom**

Although many plastics are remarkably persistent, they are not immune to degradation. Indeed the plastics industry goes to considerable effort to slow the rate
of degradation in many applications (Andrady et al. 2003). Ultraviolet (UV) radiation plays a key role in plastic degradation, and because UV light is absorbed
rapidly by water, plastics generally take much longer to degrade at sea than on
land (Andrady 2003). However, the rate of degradation depends on the ambient
temperature as well as polymer type, additives and fillers (Andrady et al. 2003).
Carpenter and Smith (1972) observed some degradation in polyethylene pellets
collected at sea, but Gregory (1987) inferred degradation occurred more rapidly
in stranded plastics, where they were exposed to high levels of UV radiation.
The proportion of degraded pellets increased higher up the beach, away from the
most recent strandline (Gregory 1987). Little is known about the fate of plastic
that sinks to the seafloor; it is widely assumed that plastic is largely impervious to
degradation once shielded from UV radiation (Goldberg 1997). However, there is
some evidence that plastic fragments may be susceptible to bacterial decay at sea
(Harshvardhan and Jha 2013; Zettler et al. 2013).
At the same time that plastics were being recognized as a significant marine pollutant, it was recognized that plastic litter was broken down by photodegradation
and oxidation (Scott 1972; Cundell 1974). Scott (1972) reported how some beach
litter items became embrittled and were reduced to small particles by very slight
pressure. The apparent lack of disintegrated plastic around such items led him to
conclude that the particles “had clearly been absorbed rapidly by the environment”


-----

(Scott 1972, p. 36). Gregory (1983) also assumed that this process led to “complete
degradation of the plastic pellets and dispersal as dust” (p. 82). However, it was a
case of out of sight, out of mind. Thompson et al. (2004) showed that microscopic
plastic fragments and fibres are ubiquitous marine pollutants. Together with the
high media profile given the Pacific ‘garbage patch’ (Moore et al. 2001) and similar litter aggregations in other mid-ocean gyres (e.g. Law et al. 2010; Eriksen et al.
2013a), the research by Thompson et al. (2004) was largely responsible for the
recent resurgence in interest in the marine litter problem (Fig. 1.2). Like larger plastic items, ‘microplastics’ (Ryan and Moloney 1990) are now found throughout the
world’s oceans, including in deep-sea sediments (van Cauwenberghe et al. 2013).
There is ongoing debate as to the size limit for ‘microplastics’ (Thompson

2015). Some authors take a broad view, including items <5 mm diameter
(Arthur et al. 2009), whereas others restrict the term to items <2 mm, <1 mm
or even <500 μm (Cole et al. 2011). Andrady (2011) argued the need for three
terms: mesoplastics (500 μm–5 mm), microplastics (50–500 μm) and nanoplastics (<50 μm), each with their own set of physical characteristics and biological
impacts. Depending on the upper size limit, industrial pellets may or may not be
included in the term. But even if we adopt a narrow view, not all microplastics
derive from degradation of larger plastic items. Some cosmetics, hand cleaners
and air blast cleaning media contain small (<500 μm) plastic beads manufactured
specifically for this purpose (Zitko and Hanlon 1991; Gregory 1996), the so-called
primary microplastics (Cole et al. 2011). The proportion of primary microplastics
in the environment probably is small compared to secondary microplastics, except
for some areas of the Great Lakes in the United States (Eriksen et al. 2013b), but
it is a largely avoidable source of pollution. Public pressure has already forced one
major chemical company to commit to phasing out the use of plastic scrubbers in
their products by 2015.
Much of the concern around microplastics concerns their role in introducing
persistent organic pollutants (POPs) into marine foodwebs (Cole et al. 2011; Ivar
do Sul and Costa 2014). Some of the additives used to modify the properties of
plastics are biologically active, potentially affecting development and reproduction
(Oehlmann et al. 2009; Meeker et al. 2009). Also, hydrophobic POPs in seawater
are adsorbed onto plastic items (Carpenter et al. 1972; Mato et al. 2001; Teuten
et al. 2009), and the smaller the particle, the more efficiently they accumulate toxins (Andrady 2011). Thompson et al. (2004) showed that invertebrates from three
feeding guilds (detritivores, deposit feeders and filter feeders) all consumed microscopic plastic particles, reinforcing the results of early selectivity experiments demonstrating that filter feeders can consume small plastic particles (De Mott 1988;
Bern 1990). Small particles also are eaten by myctophid fish (Boerger et al. 2010),
which are an important trophic link in many oceanic ecosystems (Davison and
Asch 2011). The subject of POP transfer is explored in more detail by Rochman
(2015), but it is worth noting that strict controls on the use of several POPs (e.g.
PCBs, HCHs, DDT and its derivatives) have decreased their concentrations on
plastic pellets over the last few decades (Ryan et al. 2012). There remain concerns
about the health impacts of other compounds whose use is not as strictly regulated


-----

(e.g. PBDE, BPA, phthalates, nonylphenol, etc.; Meeker et al. 2009; Oehlmann
et al. 2009; Gassel et al. 2013), and even the ingestion of uncontaminated microplastic particles can induce stress responses in fish (Rochman et al. 2013b).

**1.9 Summary and Conclusions**

Awareness of the threats posed by waste plastics to marine ecosystems developed
gradually through the 1960s and 1970s. Most of the environmental impacts of plastic litter were identified in the 1970s and 1980s, resulting in numerous policy discussions and recommendations to decrease the amount of waste plastic entering the
environment (Chen 2015). Tightened controls by plastic manufacturers and converters reduced losses of industrial pellets and legislation such as MARPOL Annex V
reduced disposal of plastic wastes at sea (although compliance remains problematic
in at least some sectors). However, it also became apparent that most litter entering
the sea did so from diffuse, land-based sources that are more difficult to control. The
rapid increase in global plastic production has resulted in an increase in the amount
of plastic items and fragments in marine systems, which in many cases has offset the
gains made by reducing losses of industrial pellets and dumping of ship-generated
wastes. Plastic is becoming so abundant in some marine systems that it is actually
altering the physical properties of the environment (e.g. Carson et al. 2011).
There was a lull in research activity in the 1990s, but the confirmation that microplastics were a ubiquitous marine pollutant in the early 2000s, coupled with publicity around the formation of mid-ocean garbage patches, has stimulated renewed
research interest and increased public awareness of the marine litter problem. One
of the most urgent current challenges is the need to develop techniques to trace the
smallest plastic particles through marine ecosystems, including uptake and release
from marine organisms. We also need an improved understanding of the dynamics of waste plastics if we are to monitor the efficacy of mitigation measures (Ryan
et al. 2009). Just as we can’t interpret the significance of plastic loads in organisms
without assessing their turnover rates (Ryan 1988a), we need estimates of transport
rates between environments and their biota, and of plastic degradation rates under
different environmental conditions. However, we already know enough to say with
certainty that the release of waste plastics into the environment is already impacting
adversely on marine systems, and affecting human quality of life. Given that plastic
litter is, at least theoretically, a wholly avoidable problem, increased effort is needed
to stop the inappropriate disposal of waste plastics through a combination of education, product design, incentives, legislation and enforcement.
