       "## Sampling Stratification\n",
       "\n",
       "Sampling stratification is a method of dividing the total sample space into non-overlapping subgroups, or strata. This is done to ensure that the sample drawn is representative of the entire population. In the context of this report, sampling stratification refers to the distribution of various land-use features in a defined buffer zone around a survey location. Land-use features might include categories such as buildings, forests, wetlands, streets, public services, recreation, vineyards, orchards, and undefined areas.\n",

       "**How do I interpret the results in the sampling stratification table?**\n",
       "\n",
       "The sampling stratification table provides information on the proportion of samples collected from different land-use features within the buffer zone around a survey location. Each row in the table represents a range of proportions (0-20%, 20-40%, etc.) of the buffer zone dedicated to a specific land-use feature. The values in each row indicate the percentage of samples collected from areas with that particular proportion of the feature. For example, a value of 6.10% in the 0-20% row under 'buildings' means that 6.10% of the samples were collected from areas where buildings occupied 0-20% of the buffer zone.\n",

       "**How do I interpret the results in the sampling stratification and trash density table?**\n",
       "\n",
       "The sampling stratification and trash density table shows how the observed litter density changes based on the land-use feature and the proportion of the buffer zone that the feature occupies. Each row represents a range of proportions of the buffer zone dedicated to a specific land-use feature. The values in each row indicate the average litter density observed in areas with that particular proportion of the feature. For example, a value of 0.678 in the 0-20% row under 'buildings' means that the average litter density was 0.678 in areas where buildings occupied 0-20% of the buffer zone."
