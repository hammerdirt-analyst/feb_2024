    "# Report on Litter Analysis in the Canton of Bern, Switzerland\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "This report investigates the distribution and determinants of litter, specifically cigarette ends, snack wrappers, drink straws, and coffee stirrers, along the shores of lakes in the Canton of Bern, Switzerland. The study aims to identify areas that would benefit most from investment in reducing plastic waste, using topographical features as key determinants. Using regression analysis, cluster analysis, and Bayesian methods, we determine the areas with the greatest need and the factors most correlated with litter presence.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The accumulation of litter in natural environments poses significant ecological and aesthetic challenges. This study focuses on the litter found on the shores of lakes in the Canton of Bern, Switzerland. Our objective is to identify the areas most in need of intervention to reduce plastic and other trash. We examine the relationships between various land use features and the density of litter to prioritize areas for investment. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Data collection followed the protocol outlined in \"A guide for monitoring litter on European seas\" and involved volunteers sampling pieces of trash per meter (pcs/m). The dataset includes land use features within a 1,500-meter buffer zone around the lakes. We conducted cluster and regression analyses, both with and without interaction terms, and utilized a Bayesian approach to predict future trends.\n",

    "## Results\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of Sample Totals\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset recorded a total of 2,299 pieces of trash over 98 samples, with an average of 0.587 pcs/m and a standard deviation of 0.832 pcs/m. The maximum recorded pcs/m was 4.04. The distribution quantiles are as follows: [0.0085, 0.12, 0.25, 0.675, 2.466].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cluster Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Cluster analysis identified three distinct clusters based on the pcs/m and the land use features. Cluster 0, consisting of 7 samples, has an average of 0.235 pcs/m and is characterized by higher forest coverage. Cluster 1, which includes 70 samples, shows an average of 0.377 pcs/m and predominantly covers undefined areas with some buildings and streets. Cluster 2, with 21 samples, has the highest average pcs/m of 1.405 and features high building density along with some forest and undefined areas.\n",

The predicted sample mean was 0.64, with a 90% interval of [0.126, 0.216, 0.895, 1.892]. When including interaction terms, the R² remained at 0.63, and the MSE was also 0.02, indicating that interaction terms did not significantly improve the model's explanatory power.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison of Predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "The linear regression predicted an average pcs/m of 0.64, while the Bayesian grid approximation predicted an average of 0.85 pcs/m. The 90% intervals for both methods overlap, suggesting reasonable agreement, with Bayesian predictions indicating potentially higher values.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Undefined areas showed high pcs/m values, possibly due to less controlled environments leading to more litter accumulation. Buildings were often associated with higher pcs/m, likely due to higher human activity and resulting litter. Forests had moderate litter levels, potentially due to lower human traffic compared to urban areas. Streets were strongly correlated with high pcs/m, supporting the hypothesis that streets lead to more litter, as confirmed by their importance in the regression model. Public services, although showing lower direct impact, were positively correlated with buildings and streets, indicating higher litter in areas with more infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis on Streets and Litter\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis supports the hypothesis that more streets lead to higher pcs/m. Streets have the highest feature importance in the regression model, indicating a strong influence on litter density.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "Both linear regression and Bayesian methods suggest that pcs/m will likely remain significant, with potential increases. Future values are expected to be between 0.64 and 0.85 pcs/m, with possible peaks up to 3.02 pcs/m.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Suggestions for Improving Inferences\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sampling Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Increased sampling frequency would provide a clearer picture of temporal variations and identify peak littering periods. Stratified sampling, ensuring that samples cover all topographical features proportionally, would improve the representativeness of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Analytical Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Utilizing more sophisticated models, such as generalized additive models (GAMs) or machine learning approaches, could capture non-linear relationships more effectively. Exploring more interaction effects and potential non-linearities between features could enhance the understanding of how different land uses influence litter distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This study highlights the significant impact of land use features on litter density along the lakeshores of the Canton of Bern. Streets and buildings are the primary contributors to litter, suggesting targeted interventions in urban areas and along roadways could be most effective. The alignment between regression and Bayesian predictions supports the robustness of the findings, providing a solid basis for future environmental management and policy-making."

    "The dataset records various types of trash (cigarette ends, snack wrappers, drink straws, and coffee stirrers) found on lake shores in the Canton of Bern, Switzerland. The data includes topographical features within a 1,500-meter buffer zone around the lakes, such as the proportion of land occupied by buildings, streets, public services, orchards, vineyards, forests, and undefined areas. The goal is to identify areas that would most benefit from investments aimed at reducing trash levels, defined by the highest pieces of trash per meter (pcs/m).\n",
    "\n",
    "A summary of the trash data reveals a total of 2,299 pieces of trash over 98 samples, averaging 0.587 pcs/m with a standard deviation of 0.832 pcs/m and a maximum of 4.04 pcs/m. Cluster analysis using the elbow point method identified three clusters: Cluster 0 (low pcs/m, higher forest proportion), Cluster 1 (moderate pcs/m, balanced proportions of buildings, forest, and undefined areas), and Cluster 2 (high pcs/m, higher proportions of buildings and public services). Comparing these clusters with the pcs/m by feature magnitude table, it is evident that areas with higher proportions of buildings and undefined areas tend to have higher trash levels, particularly in Cluster 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression analysis without interaction terms revealed a random forest model with an \\( R^2 \\) of 0.63 and a standard error of 0.02. The feature importance showed streets as the most significant predictor of pcs/m, followed by forests, buildings, public services, and undefined areas. This analysis indicates that urban features (streets, buildings) and less natural areas (undefined) have a substantial impact on litter levels. Thus, areas with these features might be prioritized for investment to reduce trash.\n",
    "\n",
    "To test the hypothesis that the presence of streets increases pcs/m when combined with other land uses, a regression analysis with interaction terms was conducted. This model also yielded an \\( R^2 \\) of 0.63 and a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.02. The feature importance rankings remained consistent: streets were the most significant predictor, followed by forests, buildings, public services, and undefined areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing the results of the regression analysis with and without interaction terms, we observe that the inclusion of interaction terms did not significantly change the model's performance metrics (both had \\( R^2 \\) of 0.63 and similar feature importance rankings). This consistency suggests that while streets are a significant predictor of pcs/m, their effect when combined with other land uses is adequately captured without explicitly modeling interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the combined analysis supports the conclusion that urban features, particularly streets and buildings, along with undefined areas, significantly impact trash levels on lake shores. The cluster analysis and regression results align, indicating that areas with higher proportions of these features experience higher pcs/m. Therefore, targeted investments in such areas, focusing on reducing trash levels, could be most beneficial in addressing environmental pollution. The hypothesis that streets increase pcs/m when combined with other land uses is consistent with these findings, reinforcing the need for comprehensive management strategies in urbanized and mixed-use areas. Undefined usage areas may have higher values for the target variable due to their ambiguous nature and potential for overlapping human activities that are not specifically managed or regulated. These areas might attract more litter due to lack of clear ownership, maintenance, or public awareness, resulting in higher trash accumulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve the quality of data and the validity of the conclusions, sampling strategies should include a more comprehensive and stratified approach. Ensuring that samples are evenly distributed across different types of land use and varying levels of human activity will help in obtaining a more representative dataset. Additionally, increasing the sample size and frequency of data collection can provide a better temporal understanding of trash accumulation patterns. Employing a mixed-method approach that includes both random and systematic sampling can also help in covering areas that might be overlooked by one method alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond the current analysis, other analytical methods and metrics can be considered. Spatial analysis techniques, such as Geographic Information System (GIS) mapping, can provide visual insights into the distribution of trash and its correlation with land use features. Incorporating temporal trends analysis can help in understanding seasonal variations and long-term patterns in trash accumulation. Additionally, machine learning algorithms beyond random forests, such as gradient boosting machines or neural networks, might capture more complex interactions between features. Introducing metrics like human foot traffic or proximity to recreational areas can also enrich the analysis, providing a more nuanced understanding of the factors contributing to higher pcs/m levels."

    "### Explanation of SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)\n",
    "\n",
    "SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is a unified framework for interpreting the predictions of machine learning models. It leverages concepts from cooperative game theory, particularly the Shapley value, to attribute the contribution of each feature to the model's prediction. SHAP values quantify the impact of each feature on the prediction by considering all possible combinations of features, ensuring a fair distribution of contribution among features. This approach not only identifies the most important features but also explains how changes in feature values influence the model's output, making it a powerful tool for model interpretability and feature importance analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of Shapley Value\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of game theory, the Shapley value is a solution concept used to distribute the total gains (or costs) generated by a coalition of players in a way that fairly reflects each player's contribution to the coalition. Developed by Lloyd Shapley in 1953, the Shapley value ensures that the distribution is both fair and equitable by considering every possible permutation of players joining the coalition. For each player, the Shapley value is the average marginal contribution of that player across all permutations. This means it calculates how much value a player adds to each possible coalition they could be a part of, and then averages these values to ensure a fair share.\n",
    "\n",
    "When applied to machine learning and data, Shapley values provide a way to interpret complex model predictions by attributing the contribution of each feature to the final prediction. Each feature is treated as a \"player\" in a coalition, and the Shapley value represents the average contribution of that feature to the model’s prediction over all possible feature combinations. This method allows for a detailed understanding of how each feature influences the outcome, making it a robust tool for model interpretability. By considering all possible interactions among features, Shapley values ensure that the contribution of each feature is fairly assessed, regardless of the presence or absence of other features in the model.\n",

    "### Comparison of SHAP and Partial Dependence Plots (PDP)\n",
    "\n",
    "### SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Purpose:\n",
    "SHAP provides a unified approach to interpreting model predictions by attributing the contribution of each feature to the final prediction. It quantifies how much each feature contributes to the prediction by considering all possible combinations of feature values, ensuring a fair distribution of contributions among features.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How It Works:\n",
    "- **Game Theory Basis**: SHAP values are based on the Shapley value concept from cooperative game theory, which ensures a fair allocation of the total gain (or prediction) among features.\n",
    "- **Local Interpretability**: SHAP values explain individual predictions by showing the impact of each feature on that specific prediction.\n",
    "- **Global Interpretability**: Aggregating SHAP values across many predictions provides insights into overall feature importance and interactions.\n",
    "- **Fairness**: By considering all possible subsets of features, SHAP values ensure that each feature's contribution is fairly assessed in the presence of other features.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strengths:\n",
    "- **Model-Agnostic**: SHAP can be applied to any machine learning model.\n",
    "- **Detailed Explanations**: Provides both local and global interpretability.\n",
    "- **Interaction Effects**: Captures interactions between features.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations:\n",
    "- **Computationally Intensive**: Calculating SHAP values can be time-consuming, especially for large datasets and complex models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Partial Dependence Plots (PDP)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Purpose:\n",
    "PDPs are used to visualize the effect of one or two features on the predicted outcome of a machine learning model. They show the average predicted outcome as a function of the feature(s) of interest, while averaging out the effects of other features.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How It Works:\n",
    "- **Marginal Effect**: PDPs plot the marginal effect of a feature by keeping other features constant or averaging their effects.\n",
    "- **Global Interpretability**: They provide a global view of how the feature(s) influence predictions across the entire dataset.\n",
    "- **Visualization**: PDPs are typically visualized as line or contour plots (for one or two features).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strengths:\n",
    "- **Simplicity**: Easy to interpret and visualize.\n",
    "- **Computationally Efficient**: Less computationally intensive compared to SHAP.\n",
    "- **Clear Effect**: Provides a clear view of the main effect of a feature on the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations:\n",
    "- **Assumes Independence**: Assumes that the feature of interest is independent of other features, which might not hold in practice.\n",
    "- **Limited Interaction Insight**: While PDPs can show interaction effects (with two features), they are less comprehensive than SHAP in capturing complex interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Interpretability Scope**:\n",
    "   - **SHAP**: Provides both local (individual prediction) and global (overall model behavior) interpretability.\n",
    "   - **PDP**: Primarily provides global interpretability, showing the average effect of a feature across the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Interactions**:\n",
    "   - **SHAP**: Captures complex interactions between features.\n",
    "   - **PDP**: Can capture interactions between two features, but generally assumes feature independence for single-feature plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Computational Complexity**:\n",
    "   - **SHAP**: More computationally intensive due to the need to consider all possible feature combinations.\n",
    "   - **PDP**: Less computationally intensive, averaging out effects of other features.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model Dependency**:\n",
    "   - **SHAP**: Model-agnostic and can be applied to any machine learning model.\n",
    "   - **PDP**: Typically implemented within specific frameworks like scikit-learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SHAP**: Best used when detailed explanations of individual predictions are needed, or when understanding complex feature interactions is crucial.\n",
    "- **PDP**: Useful for gaining a general understanding of how specific features influence predictions on average, especially in simpler models or as an initial step in model interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Both SHAP and PDP are valuable tools for interpreting machine learning models, but they serve different purposes and have different strengths and limitations. SHAP provides a more detailed and comprehensive view, especially useful for understanding individual predictions and feature interactions, while PDP offers a simpler and computationally efficient way to visualize the average effect of features on model predictions."
