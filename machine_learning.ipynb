All \\ndiscarded materials were collected and identified using litter survey techniques. in total there were 406 samples from 163 \\nlocations in 95 municipalities.\\n\\nThis report is a summary and analysis of the litter surveys conducted and the methods employed in Switzerland from March\\n2020 through August 2021. This sampling phase overlaps with the Swiss Litter Report (SLR) survey period, which ran\\nfrom April 2017 to March 2018. The SLR was the first project on a national level to use the standard protocol described in \\nthe Guide to monitoring beach litter or any other comparable method. This overlap allows the results of the \\npresent study to be compared with those of the SLR.\\n\\n## Lakes and rivers\\n\\nThe lakes and rivers were sampled from 2020-03 through 2021-05, a total of 54,744 objects were removed and classified over \\nthe course of 386 surveys. The survey locations were divided into survey areas for regional analysis and defined by the Aare, \\nRhône, Ticino and Linth/Limmat rivers. Surveys were conducted at 143 different locations, representing 77 municipalities. \\nThe total linear distance surveyed was 20 km with a surface area of 9 hectares and a total municipal population of 1.7 million.\\n\\nMost surveys were along lake shorelines (331 samples) as lakes offer more consistent and safe year-round access with \\nrespect to rivers. Additionally, lakes are large areas of reduced flow that receive input from multiple rivers, streams \\nand drainage systems providing ideal locations to assess the variety of objects in and around the water bodies.\\n\\nIn total 316 samples came from seven principal lakes in 3 major river basins. Twenty locations were selected to sample \\nmonthly for a twelve-month period with the exception of Lago Maggiore, which was sampled every three months. \\nSurveys were also conducted on Lago di Lugano, Lac des Quatre cantons, Brienzersee and Zugersee. In addition, there \\nwere 55 surveys on 16 rivers.\\n\\n### The sampling locations - type and description\\n\\nThe land use is reported as the percent of total area attributed to each land use category within a 1500m radius of the \\nsurvey location. The ratio of the number of samples completed at the different land use profiles is an indicator of the \\nenvironmental and economic conditions around the survey locations.\\n\\nThe land use around the survey locations had a higher attribution to buildings as opposed to agriculture and woods. For \\nexample, half of all the surveys had at least 37% of land use devoted to buildings as opposed to 19% for agriculture or \\n13% to woods. Land use devoted to recreation was at least 6% for half of all samples.\\n\\nThe length of the road network within the buffer zone differentiates between locations that have other wise similar land \\nuse characteristics. The length of road per buffer ranges from 13km to 212km, 50% of the surveys had less than 67km of road network.\\n\\nThe number of intersections ranges from zero to 23, 50% of the surveys had 3 or fewer intersections within 1500m of the \\nsurvey location. The size of the intersecting river or canal was not taken into consideration. Survey locations on rivers \\nhave zero intersections.\\n\\nThe population (not shown) is taken from statpop 2018 and represents the population of the municipality surrounding the \\nsurvey location. The smallest population was 442 and the maximum was 415,367, 50% of the surveys come from \\nmunicipalities with a population of at least 12,812.\\n\\nOverall, surveys at locations with more buildings and more recreation sites were more likely to facilitate the accumulation \\nof trash on the shoreline. When the most common objects are considered, only four of the twelve were found at higher rates \\nin the presence of more buildings. All of those objects are likely related to food or tobacco consumption near the location. \\nSuggesting that there are still gains to be made in prevention and attenuation efforts in areas of high traffic near the water.\\n\\nHowever, six of the twelve objects have no positive association to land use attributed to buildings but were found in at \\nleast 50% of all the surveys. These objects are generally associated with professional use or in the case of cotton swabs \\npersonal hygiene:\\n\\n* plastic construction waste\\n* fragmented plastics\\n* industrial sheeting\\n* expanded polystyrene\\n* cotton bud/swabs\\n* insulation, includes spray foams\\n\\nFurthermore, compared to products related to tobacco or food consumption these objects have fewer positive associations in \\ngeneral. Indicating that the appropriate land use feature is not currently accounted for and/or these objects are found \\nat similar quantities indifferent of the land use features. Suggesting that these objects are ubiquitous in the environment.\\n\\nFinally, two of the twelve most common objects were found in less than 50% of the surveys and have few positive associations:\\n\\n* industrial pellets\\n* expanded foams < 5mm\\n\\nThese objects are found in large quantities sporadically at specific locations. They have been found in all survey areas \\nand in all lakes. Industrial pellets have a very specific use and client base making it possible to find partners based \\non the density of the pellets found and the location of the nearest consumer or producer of pellets, see Shared responsibility.\\n\\n### Median survey total\\n\\nThe results are in units of pieces of litter per 100 meters (p/100m). The median survey result of all data was approximately\\n189 p/100m. The maximum recorded value was 6,617 p/100m (Rhône survey area) and the minimum recorded was 2p/100m (Aare survey area).\\nThe Rhône survey area had the highest median survey total of 442p/100m, this can in part be explained by the high number\\nof urban survey locations with respect to the other survey areas and the deposition of fragmented plastics and foamed \\nplastics at the Rhône River out flow in the upper lake region.\\n\\nA reference value was calculated excluding the results from samples that were less than 10m and objects less than 2.5cm. \\nThis method, described in EU Marine Beach Litter Baselines was used to calculate the reference and threshold \\nvalues for all European beaches in 2015 and 2016 resulting in a median value of 131 p/100m. The results from the European \\nbaseline value lie outside the 95% confidence interval (CI) of 147 - 213p/100m established using the data from IQAASL.\\n\\nSurveys in Switzerland were on average, smaller scale than in marine environments and in locations that would be \\nconsidered urban under most circumstances. To date monitoring of lakes and rivers upstream of coastal regions has \\nnot generalized on the European continent. However, there is a concerted effort by a group of associations in \\nSwitzerland and France to establish a common monitoring and data exchange protocol for the Rhône basin. Additionally, \\nthe Wageningen University & Research has begun analyzing data collected in the Meusse - Rhine delta using \\nprotocols like those in IQAASL.\\n\\n### The most common objects\\n\\nThe most common objects are defined as those objects identified in at least 50% of all surveys and/or are among the ten \\nmost abundant by quantity. As a group the most common objects represent 68% of all objects identified in the sampling period. \\nOf the most common items 27% are food, drink and tobacco related and 24% are infrastructure and agriculture related.\\n\\nObjects related to food, drink and tobacco are identified at higher rates at survey locations with a greater percentage \\nof land attributed to buildings or fixed infrastructure, the inverse is true of the locations with a higher percentage \\nof land attributed to woods or agriculture. However, infrastructure material and fragmented plastics, are found at similar \\nrates throughout all survey areas indifferent of land use surrounding the survey locations.\\n\\nThe most common objects identified in the surveys were:\\n\\n* cigarette ends: total 8'485, % of all objects 15.5%, fail-rate 87%, p/100m 20\\n* fragmented plastics: total 7'400, 13% of all objects, fail-rate 86%, p/100m 18\\n* expanded polystyrene: total 5'563, 10% of all objects, fail-rate 68%, p/100m ,\\n* snack wrappers: total 3'325, 6% of all objects, fail-rate 85%, p/100m 9\\n* industrial sheeting: total 2'534, 4% of all objects, fail-rate 69%, p/100m 5\\n* glass drink bottles, pieces: total 2'136, 3% of all objects, fail-rate 65%, p/100m 3\\n* industrial pellets: total 1'968, 3% of all objects, fail-rate 30%, p/100m 4\\n* insulation, includes spray foams: total 1'702, 3% of all objects, fail-rate 53%, p/100m 1\\n* cotton bud/swabs: total 1'406, 2% of all objects, fail-rate 50%, p/100m 1\\n* expanded foams < 5mm: total 1'209, 2% of all objects, fail-rate 25%, p/100m 0\\n* plastic construction waste: total 992, 1% of all objects, fail-rate 52%, p/100m 1\\n* metal bottle caps: total 700, 1% of all objects, fail-rate 52%, p/100m 1\\n\\n\\n\\nIndustrial pellets and expanded foams < 5mm both occurred in significant quantities but identified in less than 50% of \\nthe surveys (median of 0), indicating high counts at specific locations. While both are micro plastics, their use, \\norigin and rate of occurrence are different depending on the survey area region. Industrial pellets are raw materials \\nused in injection molding processes whereas foamed plastic beads are the result of fragmentation of expanded polystyrene.\\n\\n### Conclusions\\n\\nAt the national level, the IQAASL results are stable compared to the surveys that were carried out in 2017 as part of the \\nSLR study. However, there was a general decrease in the quantity of food, drink and tobacco objects. Infrastructure \\nobjects and fragmented plastics and foams did not decline and some locations may have experienced sharp increases. \\nPandemic restrictions limiting large outdoor gatherings may have had a beneficial effect on the reduction of food, drink \\nand tobacco items. The greatest increases in infrastructure related objects were in Valais, Vaud and Brienz, which are \\nlocations near the Rhône and Aare rivers discharge points.\\n\\nThe land use around a survey location has a measurable effect on the deposition of certain objects. The more buildings \\nand fixed infrastructure there are the more tobacco and food products are found. Objects like fragmented plastics and \\nindustrial sheeting do not have the same association and are identified at approximately equal rates indifferent of the \\nland use with increases near river/canal discharge points.\\n\\nCurrently three of the four survey areas in the IQAASL are actively monitored by research and governmental agencies \\ndownstream of Switzerland using similar methods presented in this report. Additionally, regional associations in \\nSwitzerland are actively pursuing a standardization of reporting and protocols with partner organizations in the EU.\\n\\nThe IQAASL is a citizen-science project that only uses open-source tools and shares data on GNU public license, \\nenabling collaboration with stakeholders. At the end of the mandate, December 31, 2021, Hammerdirt will assume the \\nresponsibility of maintaining the code and data repository which is hosted publicly on Github.\\n\\nThe associations that participated in the IQAASL are actively seeking ways to incorporate the data collection process \\nand/or the results into their own business model. However, there is a shortage of data scientists within many regional \\nassociations which may lengthen the process of integration and stifle the rate of innovation at the level where it is needed most.\\n\""

    "189 p/100m. The maximum recorded value was 6,617 p/100m (Rhône survey area) and the minimum recorded was 2p/100m (Aare survey area).\n",
    "The Rhône survey area had the highest median survey total of 442p/100m, this can in part be explained by the high number\n",
    "of urban survey locations with respect to the other survey areas and the deposition of fragmented plastics and foamed \n",
    "plastics at the Rhône River out flow in the upper lake region.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### The most common objects\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common objects are defined as those objects identified in at least 50% of all surveys and/or are among the ten \n",
    "most abundant by quantity. As a group the most common objects represent 68% of all objects identified in the sampling period. \n",
    "Of the most common items 27% are food, drink and tobacco related and 24% are infrastructure and agriculture related.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects related to food, drink and tobacco are identified at higher rates at survey locations with a greater percentage \n",

    "\n",
    "The most common objects identified in the surveys were:\n",
    "\n",
    "* cigarette ends: total 8'485, % of all objects 15.5%, fail-rate 87%, p/100m 20\n",

    "Industrial pellets and expanded foams < 5mm both occurred in significant quantities but identified in less than 50% of \n",
    "the surveys (median of 0), indicating high counts at specific locations. While both are micro plastics, their use, \n",
    "origin and rate of occurrence are different depending on the survey area region. Industrial pellets are raw materials \n",
    "used in injection molding processes whereas foamed plastic beads are the result of fragmentation of expanded polystyrene.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "At the national level, the IQAASL results are stable compared to the surveys that were carried out in 2017 as part of the \n",
    "SLR study. However, there was a general decrease in the quantity of food, drink and tobacco objects. Infrastructure \n",
    "objects and fragmented plastics and foams did not decline and some locations may have experienced sharp increases. \n",
    "Pandemic restrictions limiting large outdoor gatherings may have had a beneficial effect on the reduction of food, drink \n",
    "and tobacco items. The greatest increases in infrastructure related objects were in Valais, Vaud and Brienz, which are \n",
    "locations near the Rhône and Aare rivers discharge points.\n",
    "\n",
    "The land use around a survey location has a measurable effect on the deposition of certain objects. The more buildings \n",
    "and fixed infrastructure there are the more tobacco and food products are found. Objects like fragmented plastics and \n",
    "industrial sheeting do not have the same association and are identified at approximately equal rates indifferent of the \n",
    "land use with increases near river/canal discharge points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently three of the four survey areas in the IQAASL are actively monitored by research and governmental agencies \n",
    "downstream of Switzerland using similar methods presented in this report. Additionally, regional associations in \n",
    "Switzerland are actively pursuing a standardization of reporting and protocols with partner organizations in the EU.\n",
    "\n",
    "The IQAASL is a citizen-science project that only uses open-source tools and shares data on GNU public license, \n",
    "enabling collaboration with stakeholders. At the end of the mandate, December 31, 2021, Hammerdirt will assume the \n",
    "responsibility of maintaining the code and data repository which is hosted publicly on Github.\n",
    "\n",
    "The associations that participated in the IQAASL are actively seeking ways to incorporate the data collection process \n",
    "and/or the results into their own business model. However, there is a shortage of data scientists within many regional \n",
    "associations which may lengthen the process of integration and stifle the rate of innovation at the level where it is needed most.\n",

Thus a location with high percentage of buildings (an index of 4 or 5),\nwill have 60 - 100% of the land in the buffer dedicated to buildings.\n\nThe land use is further divided in to two groups: 1.cover , 2.use. Cover refers to those topographical features that do not overlap on a map. That is cover features are mutually \nexclusive, a given area of the buffer is either one or the other of the cover features but never both. The cover features are:\n\n* Buildings, orchards, forest, undefined, vineyards\n\nOn the other hand use refers to the activities or features that are present in the buffer and overlap the cover features. For example public services can be located within buildings \n(hospitals, schools) or in a forest (parks, nature areas). These features represent activites or, the features are:\n\n* Pubilc-services, streets, recreation\n\n#### Streets\n\nThe streets are measured as the length of the road network in the buffer. The lengths for each location are normalized from 0 - 1. Thus in the table below, the locations \nthat have the shortest road net work will be in category 1, the those with a more dense network will be higher.\n\n#### Sampling profile\n\nThe sampling profile details the proportion of samples conducted for each land use and magnitude. For example if the column is Forest and the index is 1 and the value is .3, that means\nthat 30% of the samples were taken from locations that had between 0 and 20% of the buffer dedicated to forest. \n\nThe sample results profile is the average pcs/m for each land use and magnitude. For example if For example if the column is Forest and the index is 1 and the value is .3, that means\nthat 30% of the samples were taken from locations that had between 0 and 20% of the buffer dedicated to forest. \n\nThere are two tables below. The first table is the sample results profile and the second is the sampling profile.The index is the magnitude of the feature on a scale of 1-5.\nIn the first table the average pcs/trash per meter of the combined results is given for each land-use (columns) and magnitude (index, 1-5). \n\nIn a separate paragraph for each table: Generate a narrative summary based on the following tables.\n\n\n### Objects per meter of shoreline by magnitude of feature\n|    |   buildings |   wetlands |   forest |   public-services |   recreation |   undefined |   streets |   vineyards |   orchards |\n|---:|------------:|-----------:|---------:|------------------:|-------------:|------------:|----------:|------------:|-----------:|\n|  1 |    0.774792 |   0.808112 | 1.00448  |          0.808112 |     0.808112 |    1.04115  |         0 |    0.808112 |   0.808112 |\n|  2 |    0.620588 |   0        | 0.770323 |          0        |     0        |    1.53286  |         0 |    0        |   0        |\n|  3 |    1.62094  |   0        | 0.329286 |          0        |     0        |    0.636846 |         0 |    0        |   0        |\n|  4 |    0.439    |   0        | 0        |          0        |     0        |    0        |         0 |    0        |   0        |\n|  5 |    0.41     |   0        | 0        |          0        |     0        |    0        |         0 |    0        |   0        |\n\n\n### Proportion of samples by magnitude of feature\n|    |   buildings |   wetlands |   forest |   public-services |   recreation |   undefined |   streets |   vineyards |   orchards |\n|---:|------------:|-----------:|---------:|------------------:|-------------:|------------:|----------:|------------:|-----------:|\n|  2 |   1.04082   |          0 | 1.26531  |                 0 |            0 |    0.142857 |         0 |           0 |          0 |\n|  1 |   0.489796  |          2 | 0.591837 |                 2 |            2 |    0.530612 |         0 |           2 |          2 |\n|  3 |   0.326531  |          0 | 0.142857 |                 0 |            0 |    1.32653  |         0 |           0 |          0 |\n|  4 |   0.102041  |          0 | 0        |                 0 |            0 |    0        |         0 |           0 |          0 |\n|  5 |   0.0408163 |          0 | 0        |                 0 |            0 |    0        |         0 |           0 |          0 |\n\n\n\n\n\n",

       "KMeans clustering is a popular machine learning algorithm used for clustering tasks in data analysis. It is implemented in Python's scikit-learn library, and you can find more information about it [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html). The algorithm works by partitioning the data into a predefined number of clusters based on the features provided. The elbow method is a technique used to determine the optimal number of clusters for KMeans clustering. It involves plotting the within-cluster sum of squares (inertia) against the number of clusters and identifying the \"elbow\" point where the rate of decrease in inertia slows down. The number of clusters at the elbow point is considered the optimal choice.\n",

Cluster 0 is characterized by a significant proportion of forest land use (55.9%) with moderate proportions of buildings (16.7%) and streets (9.6%). Cluster 1 shows a high proportion of undefined land use (48.6%) and forest (21.3%), with a substantial amount of buildings (30%). Cluster 2 has a dominant proportion of forest (54.1%) and buildings (30.9%), with streets (49.7%) also playing a significant role. Cluster 3 stands out with the highest proportion of buildings (68.2%) and a balanced mix of forest (15.3%) and streets (25.2%). Cluster 4 is characterized by a predominant proportion of undefined land use (55%) and forest (27.1%), with a notable presence of recreation areas (15.5%). Cluster 5 shows a diverse profile with relatively high proportions of public-services (18.8%), forest (30.8%), and streets (27.3%), along with vineyards (19.2%)."
