## Sampling stratification

Sampling stratification refers to the process of dividing a population into subgroups, or strata, based on specific characteristics, allowing for targeted sampling that reflects the diversity of the population. In this survey, sampling stratification was used to analyze the distribution of trash density based on the land-use features surrounding each survey location, which are categorized into different types such as buildings, wetlands, forests, public services, recreation, undefined, streets, vineyards, and orchards. This stratification helps assess how different land-use conditions influence the amount of trash found in each surveyed area.

Land use denotes how land is utilized, encompassing various categories that reflect human activity and natural features in the environment. The land use categories in this report are represented in the column names of the sampling stratification table, indicating the proportion of land dedicated to each category within the buffer zone. To determine urban classification, the proportion of samples from buildings in the buffer zones where they occupy more than 60% is summed. If this sum exceeds 50%, the area is deemed urban. Conversely, to classify an area as rural, a similar summation of the forest category is required, and if that sum exceeds 50%, the area is classified as rural. If both sums are below 50%, the area is labeled mixed.

The proportion of samples taken where buildings occupied greater than 60% of the buffer is calculated as follows: the sum of the proportions from the 60-80% (36.8%) and 80-100% (46.0%) rows results in 82.8% of the samples. For the forest category, the proportion of samples where forests occupied greater than 60% of the buffer is 0%, as there were no samples collected in that range. Given these results, the area would be classified as urban, as the proportion for buildings exceeds 50%, while the proportion for forests does not qualify for rural classification.

The two highest pieces per meter (pcs/m) values in the sampling stratification and trash density table are 24.73 pcs/m for streets in the 60-80% buffer category and 16.65 pcs/m for public services in the 20-40% buffer category. 

### Frequently asked questions

**What does the sampling stratification table tell us?**  
The sampling stratification table provides insight into the distribution of trash density across different land-use categories within the buffer zones. For example, in areas where buildings occupy 0-20% of the buffer, the average trash density is 4.85 pcs/m, and 6.9% of the samples were taken in this category. In contrast, where buildings occupy 80-100% of the buffer, the average trash density increases to 9.31 pcs/m with 46% of the samples collected. These values indicate the varying levels of litter based on land use and inform about the potential impact of urbanization on trash density.

**How can the information in the sampling stratification and trash density table help identify areas of concern?**  
The information in the sampling stratification and trash density table can help identify areas of concern by highlighting where higher concentrations of trash are found in relation to specific land-use categories. By analyzing the average pieces of trash per meter (pcs/m) associated with different land uses, stakeholders can prioritize cleanup efforts and interventions in areas with significant litter issues, such as streets and public services, which show higher trash density.

**Under what land-use conditions would a surveyor expect to find the most trash?**  
Surveyors would expect to find the most trash in conditions where buildings occupy a large proportion of the buffer zone. For instance, the highest average pcs/m value of 24.73 is observed in the streets category where the buffer occupied is at 60-80%. Another significant average of 16.65 pcs/m is found in public services within the 20-40% buffer range. These conditions suggest that urbanized areas, particularly those with high traffic and public service presence, tend to accumulate more litter.

**Given the results in the sampling stratification table, were these surveys collected in mostly urban environments or forested?**  
Based on the sampling stratification results, the surveys were conducted in mostly urban environments. The proportion of the buffer that contains the greatest proportion of samples for buildings is 82.8% (sum of the 60-80% and 80-100% categories), while for forest, it is 0%, indicating no significant forested areas were sampled. The undefined category also does not contribute to rural classification.

## Linear and ensemble regression

Cluster analysis, specifically K-means, is a method used to partition data into distinct groups or clusters based on similarities within the data points. The algorithm assigns each data point to the nearest cluster centroid, which is recalculated iteratively until convergence is reached, minimizing the variance within each cluster.

Linear regression is a statistical method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. The basic assumptions of linear regression include linearity, independence, homoscedasticity (constant variance of errors), and normality of error terms. 

Ensemble regression combines multiple regression models to improve prediction accuracy. Common ensemble methods include bagging and boosting. The basic assumptions for ensemble regression methods are similar to those of linear regression but may vary depending on the specific ensemble technique used.

The regression analysis conducted identified the Theil-Sen Regressor as the model with the highest r² value of 0.50, indicating it as the best model among those tested. The mean squared error (MSE) for this model was 0.10.

Given the r² and MSE of the best model, predictions can be considered moderately reliable since an r² value of approximately 0.5 suggests that about half of the variance in the dependent variable can be explained by the model. The relatively low MSE indicates that predictions are close to the actual values on average.

The features that might have the greatest influence on the target variable, based on the model feature importance results, include public-services, streets, and buildings, which have the highest coefficients in the analysis.

### Frequently asked questions

**What were the r² and MSE of each test?**  
The results of the regression analysis showed the following r² and MSE values for each model: Linear Regression had an r² of -1.05 and an MSE of 0.42; Random Forest Regression had an r² of -2.69 and an MSE of 0.76; Gradient Boosting Regression had an r² of 0.42 and an MSE of 0.12; Theil-Sen Regressor had an r² of 0.50 and an MSE of 0.10; Bagging: Theil-Sen Regressor had an r² of 0.48 and an MSE of 0.11; Voting had an r² of -0.43 and an MSE of 0.29.

**Given the r² and MSE of the different methods employed, how reliable do you think predictions would be based on these models?**  
Predictions based on the models show varying reliability. The Theil-Sen Regressor, with the highest r² of 0.50 and an MSE of 0.10, suggests moderate reliability in its predictions. However, other models such as Linear and Random Forest Regression show negative r² values, indicating poor predictive performance.

**Can any conclusions be drawn from these results?**  
Conclusions indicate that while some models like the Theil-Sen Regressor provide a moderate fit to the data, others are not reliable for making predictions due to negative r² values, suggesting they do not explain the variance in the data effectively.

**According to the cluster analysis, what is the cluster that has the greatest average pcs/m? What is the distribution of land use values within the cluster?**  
Cluster 4 has the greatest average density of 19.00 objects per meter of beach. The distribution of land use values within this cluster is as follows: buildings occupy 0.95 (95%), public-services 0.38 (38%), recreation 0.04 (4%), and undefined land use occupies 0.01 (1%).

## Forecasts and methods

Grid approximation is a mathematical technique used to estimate the distribution of a parameter, specifically in this report, the litter density in the Vaud canton. This method utilizes conditional probability to infer potential observations based on previously noted data under similar conditions, which includes factors such as land use features. In Bayesian statistics, a prior distribution represents the initial beliefs or assumptions about a parameter before observing data, while a posterior distribution is the revised belief after considering the observed data. 

In this report, three priors were utilized:

1. **Combined prior grid approximation**: Similarity threshold = 0.76
2. **In boundary grid approximation**: Similarity threshold = 0.43
3. **Out boundary grid approximation**: Similarity threshold = 0.76

The differences between these priors primarily lie in their geographical focus: the combined prior considers locations both inside and outside the administrative boundary, the in-boundary prior focuses solely on locations within the boundary, while the out-boundary prior examines only those outside the boundary.

The expected posterior distributions, measured in pcs/m, are as follows:

- Combined prior: Mean = 1.76
- In boundary prior: Mean = 2.99
- Out boundary prior: Mean = 1.68
- Observed average pcs/m = 6.42

Comparing the expected averages of the different priors to the observed average shows a notable decrease in the expected values. For instance, the in-boundary prior shows a mean of 2.99, which is lower than the observed average of 6.42 by 3.43 pcs/m. With the standard deviations being 4.18 (in-boundary) and 9.31 (observed), an individual taking one sample may not reliably notice this change due to the high variability in observed data.

### Frequently asked questions

**1. Why is grid approximation a reasonable modeling technique given the data?**  
The grid approximation technique is suitable because it allows for the estimation of litter density even when the data may not be normally distributed. In this case, the observed mean is 6.42 pcs/m, while the median is 3.62 pcs/m, indicating a positive skew in the data. If the data were normally distributed, predictions would assume equal mean and median values. However, due to the skew, predictions based on the mean may be less reliable.

**2. Do you have an example of other fields or domains that use a grid approximation or Bayesian methods?**  
Grid approximation and Bayesian methods are commonly utilized in fields such as ecology for species distribution modeling, finance for risk assessment, and machine learning for predictive analytics.

**3. If the data is normally distributed, would the predictions from the grid approximation and the predictions from the normal distribution be different? If so, in what way?**  
Yes, predictions would differ if the data were normally distributed. In a normal distribution, the mean and median would coincide, leading to a more precise estimate of central tendency. The grid approximation would reflect variability in the data, potentially yielding a wider range of predicted values.

**4. What is the difference between grid approximation and linear or ensemble regression?**  
Grid approximation focuses on estimating distributions and probabilities based on prior information and observed data, while linear regression predicts a single outcome based on independent variables. Ensemble regression combines multiple models to improve predictive accuracy, emphasizing model diversity rather than probabilistic estimation.

**5. With which posterior do we expect to find most? The least?**  
The in-boundary prior is expected to yield the highest average at 2.99 pcs/m, while the out-boundary prior is anticipated to yield the lowest average at 1.68 pcs/m.

**6. If the in-boundary grid approximation predicts an increase or decrease, what does that say about the other samples from within the boundary?**  
If the in-boundary prior predicts an increase, it suggests that elevated litter densities were observed in other locations within the boundary compared to the likelihood. This indicates a potential trend of higher litter accumulation in those areas.

**7. If the out-boundary grid approximation predicts an increase or decrease, what does that say about the other samples from outside of the boundary?**  
If the out-boundary prior predicts an increase, it implies that locations outside the boundary had elevated litter densities in comparison to the likelihood, suggesting a concerning accumulation of litter in those regions as well.

**8. How different are the expected results from the observed results? Should an increase or decrease be expected?**  
The expected results from the various priors are significantly lower than the observed results. For instance, the in-boundary prior's mean of 2.99 pcs/m is 3.43 pcs/m lower than the observed average of 6.42 pcs/m. Given the standard deviations, it is unlikely that a person would notice this decrease with a single sample, due to the variability inherent in the data.
