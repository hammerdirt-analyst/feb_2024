## Sampling stratification

Sampling stratification refers to the method of dividing a population into subgroups (or strata) that share similar characteristics, which in this case is the land use surrounding the survey locations. Each survey location is surrounded by a buffer zone of 1,500 meters, which is classified by the proportion of various land-use features, such as buildings, forests, wetlands, public services, recreation, undefined areas, streets, vineyards, and orchards. The purpose of this stratification is to understand how different land uses might influence the density of trash observed in the survey.

In the sampling stratification and trash density table, the highest pieces of trash per meter (pcs/m) values are found in the columns for buildings and undefined areas. Specifically, for buildings, the highest pcs/m value is 2.00, which occurs in the 40-60% buffer zone, where the proportion of samples collected is 1.2%. This suggests that in areas where buildings constitute 40-60% of the buffer zone, there is a considerable density of trash relative to other land uses. For the undefined category, the highest pcs/m value is 1.26, found in the 0-20% buffer zone, where the samples collected from this area account for 86.7%. This means that areas with a significant proportion of undefined land use also exhibit a high density of trash.

### Frequently asked questions

**1. What does the sampling stratification table tell us?**  
The sampling stratification table provides insights into how the density of trash varies with different land-use features. For instance, in the buildings column, the highest pcs/m value is 2.00 in the 40-60% buffer zone, where only 1.2% of the samples were collected. This indicates that in locations where buildings occupy a moderate proportion of the surrounding area, trash density is notably high. In contrast, in the undefined column, the highest pcs/m value is 1.26, which occurs in the 0-20% buffer zone, where 86.7% of the samples were collected. This shows that undefined areas, even in low proportions, can contribute to significant trash density.

**2. How can the information in the sampling stratification and trash density table help identify areas of concern?**  
The information in the sampling stratification and trash density table can help identify areas of concern by highlighting specific land-use categories that contribute to higher trash density. For example, if a significant number of samples are collected from areas with high pcs/m values, such as the buildings category with 2.00 pcs/m, it indicates that these locations may require targeted clean-up efforts or further investigation to understand the sources of litter. By focusing on these land-use features, environmental managers can prioritize interventions in the most affected areas, potentially reducing overall litter in the region.

**3. Under what land-use conditions would a surveyor expect to find the most trash?**  
A surveyor would expect to find the most trash in areas where buildings occupy a significant proportion of the buffer zone. For instance, in the 40-60% buffer zone, the average pcs/m is 2.00, indicating a high density of trash in areas where buildings represent a considerable proportion of the surrounding land use. Additionally, areas classified as undefined also show high trash density, with an average pcs/m of 1.26 in the 0-20% buffer zone, suggesting that even minimal land-use classifications can contribute to litter.

**4. Given the results in the sampling stratification table, were these surveys collected in mostly urban environments or forested?**  
Based on the provided definitions, the surveys were collected in predominantly urban environments. The sum of the proportions of samples for buildings in the rows 60-80% (0.39) and 80-100% (0.48) equals 0.87, which is greater than 50%, indicating an urban classification. Conversely, the sum for forests in the same rows equals 0, indicating there are no rural characteristics. Therefore, the surveyed locations can be classified primarily as urban, with the greatest proportion of buffer occupied by buildings (48.2% in the 80-100% buffer zone).

## Linear and ensemble methods

Cluster analysis, specifically K-means clustering, is a statistical method used to partition a dataset into distinct groups or clusters based on similarities among data points. In this method, the optimal number of clusters is determined using the elbow method, which helps identify the point where the addition of more clusters yields diminishing returns in variance reduction.

The cluster that had the highest average objects per meter of beach (pcs/m) was Cluster 3, with a value of 2.14. The composition of this cluster in terms of land use features is as follows: buildings occupied 0.95 (or 94.5%) of the average proportion of the buffer zone, forest occupied 0.04 (or 4.1%), and undefined land use comprised 0.01 (or 1.4%).

Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. The basic assumptions of linear regression include linearity, independence of errors, homoscedasticity (constant variance of errors), and normality of error terms. Ensemble regression, on the other hand, combines multiple predictive models to improve performance. It assumes that the combined predictions of several models will be more accurate than any single model alone. Basic assumptions for ensemble methods include the diversity of the individual models and that the errors of the models should not be correlated.

The regression analysis conducted revealed that the model with the highest R² was the Voting model, which had an R² of 0.12 and a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.33. Given these results, conclusions can be drawn regarding the predictive capability of this model, but the relatively low R² suggests that the model explains only a small portion of the variability in the data. Consequently, predictions made using this model may have limited reliability given the modest R² value and the associated MSE.

### Frequently asked questions

**What were the r² and MSE of each test?**  
The results from the regression analysis are as follows:

|    | Model                            |         R² |      MSE |
|---:|:---------------------------------|-----------:|---------:|
|  0 | Linear Regression                | -0.02      | 0.38     |
|  1 | Random Forest Regression         |  0.09      | 0.34     |
|  2 | Gradient Boosting Regression     |  0.05      | 0.35     |
|  3 | Theil-Sen Regressor              | -0.53      | 0.56     |
|  4 | Bagging:Random Forest Regression |  0.02      | 0.36     |
|  5 | Voting                           |  0.12      | 0.33     |

**Given the r² and MSE of the different methods employed, how reliable do you think predictions would be based on these models?**  
The reliability of predictions based on these models varies significantly. The R² values indicate that none of the models fit the data particularly well, with the highest R² being 0.12 for the Voting model. The mean squared errors (MSE) also suggest variability in predictions, with the best model having an MSE of 0.33. Overall, predictions may be considered unreliable, particularly if the goal is to make precise forecasts.

**Can any conclusions be drawn from these results?**  
Yes, several conclusions can be drawn from these results. The low R² values across all models indicate a weak relationship between the predictors and the response variable. This may suggest that the selected features may not sufficiently capture the complexity of the data or that there are other variables not included in the analysis that could better explain the outcomes.

**According to the cluster analysis what is the cluster that has the greatest average pcs/m? What is the distribution of land use values within the cluster?**  
The cluster with the greatest average pcs/m is Cluster 3, which had an average of 2.14 objects per meter of beach. The distribution of land use values within Cluster 3 is as follows: buildings occupied approximately 94.5% of the buffer zone, forest occupied 4.1%, and undefined land use comprised about 1.4%.

## Forecasts and methods

A grid approximation is a statistical modeling technique that allows researchers to estimate the conditional probability of survey results exceeding or equaling specific values. This method is constructed by creating a grid that spans the range of possible values based on prior observations and new data from the location under study. An inference table is a structured representation of data that includes prior distributions, observed data, and posterior distributions, facilitating the application of Bayesian inference. 

In Bayesian inference, the prior refers to the initial belief about the probability distribution of a parameter before observing new data. The posterior is the updated belief after incorporating observed data, calculated using Bayes' Theorem. In the context of an inference table, the prior is established based on previous surveys, while the posterior reflects the integration of this prior with the new likelihood data from the current study.

For the report results, the following priors and their similarity thresholds are identified: 
- **In boundary prior**: Similarity threshold of 1.76 pcs/m
- **Out boundary prior**: Similarity threshold of 1.61 pcs/m

Comparing the different posterior distributions to the observed results, we find the following average pcs/m:
- **Observed average**: 1.18 pcs/m
- **In boundary average**: 1.76 pcs/m (increase of 0.58 pcs/m)
- **Out boundary average**: 1.61 pcs/m (increase of 0.43 pcs/m)

Given these results, an increase in trash density is expected in both boundary conditions compared to the observed results. 

If a person takes one sample, the likelihood of noticing an increase from the observed results would be moderate, considering the observed average and standard deviation (1.40 pcs/m). With two samples, the likelihood of observing an increase would be higher due to the reduced variability in average results, as averaging two samples would smooth out anomalies.

### Frequently asked questions

**1. Why is grid approximation a reasonable modeling technique given the data?**  
Grid approximation is reasonable for this data because the observed results show a mean value of 1.18 pcs/m and a median of 0.77 pcs/m. The significant difference between the mean and median indicates that the data may not be normally distributed, suggesting that the presence of outliers could skew the mean. If the data were normally distributed, predictions would be more reliable and centered around the mean; however, the skewness implies that predictions could vary more widely.

**2. Do you have an example of other fields or domains that use grid approximation or Bayesian methods?**  
Yes, grid approximation and Bayesian methods are commonly used in fields such as ecology for estimating species distributions, in finance for risk assessment, and in machine learning for probabilistic modeling.

**3. If the data is normally distributed, would the predictions from the grid approximation and the predictions from the normal distribution be different? If so, in what way?**  
Yes, if the data is normally distributed, predictions from the grid approximation might align closely with those from a normal distribution. However, if the actual distribution exhibits skewness or kurtosis, the grid approximation would provide a more accurate representation of the likelihoods across different values, particularly in the tails of the distribution.

**4. What is the difference between grid approximation and linear or ensemble regression?**  
Grid approximation focuses on estimating probabilities across a range of values using prior and likelihood data, while linear regression predicts an outcome based on a linear relationship among variables. Ensemble regression combines multiple models to improve prediction accuracy. Grid approximation does not assume a specific functional form between variables, making it more flexible for complex data.

**5. With which posterior do we expect to find most? The least?**  
The in-boundary grid approximation is expected to yield the highest average (1.76 pcs/m) due to its reliance on prior data from within the same geographic boundary, suggesting a higher density of trash. Conversely, the out-boundary grid approximation is expected to yield the lowest average (1.61 pcs/m) as it relies on data from outside the geographic boundary.

**6. If the in-boundary grid approximation predicts an increase or decrease, what does that say about the other samples from within the boundary?**  
If the in-boundary prior predicts an increase, it suggests that elevated values are likely observed in other locations within the boundary. This indicates a trend of increased trash density in the area, likely reflecting broader environmental or behavioral factors affecting the boundary region.

**7. If the out-boundary grid approximation predicts an increase or decrease, what does that say about the other samples from outside of the boundary?**  
If the out-boundary prior predicts an increase, it implies that locations outside of the designated region likely exhibit elevated trash density levels compared to the likelihood data. This may indicate that trash density is a broader issue affecting the surrounding areas, not just confined to the interior of the boundary.

**8. How different are the expected results from the observed results? Should an increase or decrease be expected?**  
The expected results from the in-boundary average (1.76 pcs/m) and out-boundary average (1.61 pcs/m) are higher than the observed average (1.18 pcs/m). Specifically, the in-boundary average indicates an increase of approximately 0.58 pcs/m, while the out-boundary average shows an increase of about 0.43 pcs/m. Both suggest that an increase in trash density should be expected in future observations compared to the current observed results.
